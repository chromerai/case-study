If you cannot get a good enough look, you may need to remove the door from the fridge.

        "description": "This crisper cover front support is used to keep the crisper shelf in place and may need replacing if the door will not open or close. This white, OEM part measures roughly 1 inch in diameter and can be used for the front and the rear support, as designed by the manufacturer, and mounts to the inside cabinet wall. Replacing this part is an easy repair, and will require a small flat blade screwdriver, a putty knife, and a soft hammer. Remove the crisper and shelf from the refrigerator before replacing the support. The crisper cover front support is held in place with a locking pin. To remove the old part, you will first need to push the pin into the interior of the cabinet using the screwdriver, and then you can pull the support out with a putty knife. If you cannot get the pin out you can use a flat-blade screwdriver to push it down and out of sight and it will not harm anything in your refrigerator After removing the pin and attaching the new support, simply use the soft hammer to lock the new pin in place.",

By absorbing heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, chlorine, and much more, this filter provides delicious and healthy drinking water. This filter measures 2 inches deep, 9 inches high, 2 inches wide, and weighs 0.9 lbs. The installation is quick and easy with a push and twist feature. Don't forget to run water through the dispenser for about three minutes or 1.5 gallons to prepare the filter before use. For best performance replace this filter every six months.",

Here is information from your owner's manual on hot to remove and install a water filter in your refrigerator: It is not necessary to turn the water supply off\nto change the filter. Be ready to wipe up any small amounts of water released during the\nfilter replacement. 1 Turn Off the ice maker power switch.\n\t 2\t Remove the old filter by rotating it counterclockwise (to the left) 90 degrees to release it.\n\t 3\t Slide the old filter cartridge straight out of the housing and discard it.\n\t 4\t Unpackage the new filter cartridge. Slide it into the filter housing as far as it will go with the grip end horizontal.\n\t 5\t Push lightly inward on the filter while rotating it clockwise (to the right). The filter will then\npull itself inward as it is rotated. Rotate the filter 90 degrees until it stops and the grip end is vertical. You may be able to feel a very light click as the filter locks into place. 6 Press a drinking glass against the water dispenser while checking for any leaks at the filter housing. Any spurts and sputters\nthat occur as the system purges air out of the dispenser system are normal. 7 Continue dispensing water for 3-4 minutes or until 1.5 gallons of water has flowed through the system. You will likely need to empty and refill your glass several times. 8 Turn On the ice maker. 9 Press and hold the Water Filter reset button on the control panel for three seconds. When the display changes from\nRed to Green, the status has been reset.  We hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

In bottom-freezer refrigerators, the filter is in the bottom left grille. In top-freezer units, the filter is located in the middle of the refrigerator. This NSF certified filter reduces 28 contaminants including pharmaceuticals, metals, minerals, pesticides, cysts, industrial chemicals, Class I Particulates and chlorine. It is made up of coconut carbon block and has three layers of filtration. The first layer is particle filtration that helps block larger contaminants. The second layer is micro-filtration, which prevents medium-sized impurities from passing. The third layer is called absorption filtration, which absorbs microscopic-sized pollutants. It measures 2 inches deep, 2 inches wide, 1-1/2 inches high, and weighs 0.5 lbs. To ensure your filter is working its best, it needs to be replaced every six months. This single filter has a simple, quick-turn installation feature that does not require any tools.",

Once the water has been frozen the cubes will be ejected from the mold in to the ice bucket.  The ice maker will continue the process until the ice bucket has reached the limit. If your ice maker is not making ice you may need to replace this part. Please remember to disconnect the power and water supply before starting your repair. This ice maker is a genuine OEM part.",

This thermostat controls and regulates the ice maker ejection cycle by monitoring the temperature inside the freezer to determine when to release the ice into the bin and start the ice making cycle again. If your ice maker is making unusual noises, or if the ice maker is not making or dispensing ice, there could be an issue with the thermostat. You can test this thermostat with a multimeter to see if it has continuity. If the thermostat does not have continuity you would want to replace the thermostat itself. I hope this helps!"

If the ice is not dispensing, you can try to remove the ice container and let it sit out to thaw any ice build up within the container. If this does not fix the issue you can take the bin apart and check for any damaged parts within the container. You should be able to hear the motor in the container when it is trying to dispense. If the motor is not turning on to dispense, you may have a defective Motor, Part Number: PS11740462. Hope this helps!"

                "answer": "Hi Ken, thank you for your question. In most cases, if both of the solenoids on your water inlet valve are testing within 500 - 1500 ohms of resistance, then the problem would be with the ice maker not calling up water to start making the ice. Which means that you may have to replace your ice maker itself if the issue is not in your water valve. Good luck with your repair."

The arm should be in the up position until it cycles. The ice maker has an automatic shutoff to keep the storage bin from overfilling during normal operation. As ice is made, the ice cubes will fill the ice storage bin, and the ice cubes will raise the shutoff arm to the OFF (arm up) position. When the storage bin is at full capacity, the ice maker will automatically stop ice production, but the ice maker On/Off switch will remain in the ON (up) position.  Try and press the on/off switch and then lowering the arm manually to see if this helps.  If it not you may have to refer to the diagnostics tech sheet that came with your refrigerator or contact Whirlpool for more information.    I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

This part is red in color, and is about 1 inch in diameter. The evaporator fan grommet is located behind the evaporator fan cover in the back of the freezer. You will need to remove the evaporator fan cover to access the evaporator fan and complete this repair. Before you begin this repair, ensure the power to the refrigerator is disconnected. You will need a pair of needle nose pliers, a small flat blade screw driver and both a 1/4 and 5/16-inch nut driver to complete this repair.",

Aside from that, check the evaporator fan motor itself. It may have ice clogging it or  the fan blades may be damaged.\n\nI hope this helps."

Could it be the grommets worn out and not causing the blade to turn properly centered? The fan turns freely. Could the cover itself have warped over time and now contacts the blade as it turns? I assume the motor itself is ok, since it works. Thanks and you guys have a great site. It’s helped me many times!!!",

The parts are : Defrost Thermostat Part Number: WR50X10068,  Temperature Sensor Part Number: WR55X10025, Defrost Heater and Bracket Assembly Part Number: WR51X10055, and Evaporator Fan Motor Part Number: WR60X10185 first.

Tightening the wheel may result in the breaking of the center hub. If these are not the issues, you may need to check the drive motor, part number PS3500893, to fix the issue. If the drive motor is faulty and is running faster than the normal speed, it may result in the breaking of the wheel. We hope this helps, good luck with this repair!"

        "description": "This mullion hinge pin is a genuine OEM replacement part, measuring 1.5 inches by 1.25 inches by 0.85 inches. It is specially designed to secure the mullion in refrigerators, allowing it to pivot and ensure smooth door movement. The mullion acts as a barrier between the refrigerator and freezer to maintain the desired temperatures for each section. A damaged or loose hinge pin will result in temperature fluctuations, frost buildup along the door edges, and difficulties opening and closing the door. Therefore, it is important that you replace the pin as soon as it is no longer functioning. Note that your appliance may require two hinge pins, one near the top of the mullion and one near the bottom. Remove the mullion cover, detach the hinge pin, and install a the new one into the hinge assembly. Place the cover back on and verify that the hinge assembly is working by carefully opening and closing the refrigerator doors to check that they are moving smoothly. Each sold individually.",

        "description": "The lower door closing cam is used in refrigerator doors, it can be located on the fresh food side or the freezer side. It helps hold the door open. This cam is made out of plastic, so it might crack or wear down over time. If your door will not open and close properly you may need to replace the door closing cam. To successfully install this part, you will need a 5/16 nut driver and a small flat blade screwdriver. Before you begin, unplug your appliance and disconnect the water supply. Lubricating this part may help with installation. This replacement part is sold individually. This part will fit both the left and right side of your refrigerator door. To make the repair, remove the top hinge cover, then the top hinge support. Lift the door from the bottom support and remove the old door cams. Replace the cams, using a little lubricant if necessary, and place the door back on the lower hinge support. Replace the top hinge support and your repair is complete!",

If all of those parts are fine however, you may have to look at replacing your door gasket. I hope this helps. Good luck with your repair."

                "answer": "Hi Roman,\nThank you for your question.  If your dishwasher does not complete a cycle, open and close the door to see if it is latching properly.  If it is, check the breaker to see if it has tripped.  If the breaker is fine, you may have a failed heating element.  A failed heating element can cause the dishwasher to stop mid-cycle.  You will need to test the heating element with a multimeter.  To test the element, set your multimeter to Rx1 and touch each probe to a terminal. Your reading should be somewhere between zero and infinity, refer to your owner’s manual to determine what reading you should receive for your model. If it is exactly zero or infinity it is defective.  If your test produces a reading different from the manufacturer’s recommendation, you will need a replacement heating element.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

If you cannot get a good enough look, you may need to remove the door from the fridge. The second thing to inspect would be your door seal, if it is loose and caught on something it could be preventing your door from closing as well.

It is specially designed to withstand extreme temperatures, which is why these replacement bulbs are most often used to light the inside of refrigerators and ranges. It features a standard socket base, which means you simply unscrew the burnt-out bulb and screw in the replacement. Depending on the appliance you may require a screwdriver or nut driver to access the light bulb. We recommend you wear work gloves while handling this replacement part. It is constructed of glass and metal and is sold individually. Depending on the appliance and location of the bulb within it, you may want to consider disconnecting power and using a flashlight for easier access to unscrewing and re-screwing in your bulb during this repair.",

It is specially designed to withstand extreme temperatures, so this bulb is compatible with a variety of appliance types including refrigerators, ranges, microwaves, and dryers. It features a frosted glass bulb with a standard metal socket base, which allows you to easily unscrew the burnt-out light and twist the new bulb into place. Depending on your appliance, there may be a guard or cover protecting the lightbulb, in which case you may require additional tools to remove the cover. We recommend disconnecting the power supply to your appliance before changing the lightbulb.",

Wait approximately 30 minutes for the oven to cool and try to unlock the door.\n We hope this information helps. Please contact us anytime if you require further assistance."

We have researched the model you have provided and have found the part you are looking for is PartSelect Number PS12070396 for the Fresh Food Section LED Light Assembly. Before starting the repair, make sure the appliance is not plugged into its power source. There will be a Philips head screw that holds the light cover in place. Once removed, pull the cover off from the back. It could be tight so you need a bit of force. There will be two tabs on the left side of the light module to hold the assembly in place. Release the tabs and drop the module down. Unplug the module and do the reverse to put it back together. If you need help placing an order, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!"

A door gasket is used to create a barrier between the warmer, ambient temperature of your home, and the cooler interior of the refrigerator. But if used for a long period of time, or simply after general wear and tear, this gasket can tear, break, and/or warp. If your gasket is broken, warped, or moldy, it will need to be replaced immediately. To replace this gasket, carefully peel out the old gasket and discard it, then carefully wrap the new gasket around the frame of the fridge door to install it. This door gasket is white and rectangular and measures 28.5 inches long, .75 inches thick, and approximately 42 inches wide. This door gasket is sold individually and does not come with any other parts or accessories.",

If the refrigerator is too warm and it is leaking, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the defrost timer, the evaporator fan motor, the defrost thermostat, the door gasket and the cold control thermostat.  If it is leaking, check to make sure that the drain tube is not clogged with debris as this will sometimes cause water to pool and leak.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

To solve this issue, you may need to check the start relay, part number PS963826, as it is most likely faulty and may need to be replaced. Glad to be of assistance!"

If your refrigerator light will not turn on, there could be an issue with the switch. The switch is spring loaded and is a generally closed type of switch meaning there should be no continuity when the button is depressed, and continuity through the switch when the button is not depressed. This plastic, white, OEM switch is sourced directly from the manufacturer, is sold individually and is easy to replace. The repair usually takes less than 15 minutes and requires a flat blade screwdriver and needle nose pliers.",

Your thoughts sir?",
                "answer": "Hi Norby,\nThank you for your question.  According to your owner's manual, this alert will sound to alert you that the door has been open for 5 minutes or more. The door ajar LED will illuminate and the audible alert will sound until the door is closed.  The audible alert can be turned off by pressing the Alert RESET key or by closing the door.  If the door is ajar for 15 minutes, the interior light will turn off.  Sometimes resetting the refrigerator by unplugging it for a few minutes will reset it.  If this does resolve the issue, you will need to check the control board, the door switch and the gasket.  If the gasket is not sealing correctly air may get inside.  Once you have determined the part you need, please feel free to call customer service.  We are open 7 days a week and anyone will be happy to assist you.  We look forward to hearing from you!"

                "answer": "Hi Terry,\nThank you for your question.  It is possible for the boards to got out at the same time, but check the door switch to see it is working correctly.  To test the door switch, you will need to remove it from the refrigerator to see if it has continuity.  Before removing and testing it, unplug the refrigerator from the electrical outlet.  Set your multimeter to the Rx1 setting to test the switch for continuity and place the probes on the switch’s terminals. The multimeter reading should change from infinity to a reading of zero. Keep the leads touching the terminals and press in on the switch. The reading should change back to infinity. If the results you receive are not consistent with these results, you need a replacement door switch. We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know."

With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced.\n\nHope this helps!"

                "question": "Came home from being out of town for 3 days and everything defrosted and temps in freezer and refrigerator were 72 degrees.   Contacted our appliance repair guy.  It took him quite a while to figure out and believed it was the condensor inverter  and the motherboard (that he said was \"fried\").    He replaced both items (...it took a good part of 2 days...).   it appeared that all was working and both sides of frig were starting to get cold; we had to leave town again.    when we got home 2 days later, both sides were at 72 degrees again.    we called repair guy who was coming the next morning.    when he arrived, all was operating fine, and temps were \"very close\" to their good settings (i.e. freezer @ 0  and  other side @ 35 degrees).     hard to fix something that's working.    we've continued to \"check the temps\" every few hours the past 7 days and all has been ok.   tonight we went to the freezer and everything liquid again (...we haven't put any meat in freezer until we know all ok....).  temps at 45 47 degrees (both sides).   compressor is \"cool to the touch\" (i.e. not running) but fan is running.   i'm thinking that maybe its the temperature sensor(s) causing the problem.       any ideas?   we've already spent $650 on repairs + cost of all food in frig & freezer being lost.   the 36\" GE monogram (counter depth), side by side  is 9 years old.",
                "answer": "Hi Diane,\nThank you for your question.  I'm sorry to hear about this.  If the refrigerator and the freezer are too warm than the part that fixes majority of the time is the temperature sensor.  You may want to also check the evaporator fan motor and the condenser fan motor as well to make certain they are working correctly.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

I would recommend checking to make sure the evaporator motor is working properly, buy turning the fan blade and pushes the air into the fridge and circulates the around around all the items in the fridge.

This can also occur if the water is splashing or leaking during the fill cycle. Adjusting the water to a lower level may also help. If the load in the freezer is less then half full, it can also cause the temperature during the defrost cycle, to get warmer and may cause the ice to fuse together at a faster rate.

        "description": "This refrigerator defrost thermostat is a genuine OEM part and is sourced directly from the manufacturer. Located on the back wall of the freezer section in the refrigerator, the defrost thermostat is used to regulate the appliances temperature to keep the refrigerator cold and constant. The part is made of plastic, and has a 4 inch terminal on the white lead and a 6 inch terminal on the red lead. A refrigerator defrost thermostat may need to be replaced if the appliance is experiencing temperature related issues such as: too cold, too warm, frost buildup, not running, or running too long.",

                "answer": "Hi Judi, Thank you for the question. The messages are on the display because the temperature in the freezer is to warm. This is most likely caused by a defective defrost thermostat.You can teat the thermostat,The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps!"

If there is ice on the coils at the back of the fridge by the compressor check to be sure the condenser fan motor is running. If the ice is on the coils in the back wall of the unit where the defrost thermostat is, that is a likely issue with the heater/thermostat. I hope this helps!"

If you have just replaced the evaporator fan motor and the everything in the refrigerator is now frozen, check the temperature settings to see if they are too low.  If the temperature is set correctly, you will need to check the thermistors in the refrigerator to see if they are working correctly.  A thermistor senses the temperature in the refrigerator. You will need to the test the thermistor with a multimeter to see if it has continuity.  Before removing and testing these parts, please unplug the refrigerator from the electrical outlet.  Thermistors will produce different multimeter readings based on their temperature when you test them. The ranges below only apply to thermistors at 32 degrees F. Before testing them, you will need to place the thermistors in ice water for 5 minutes to bring the temperature to 32 degrees F. Set your multimeter to the Rx1 setting and touch the probes to the terminals, you should receive a reading of 16,600 ohms (+/- 5 percent).\nIf you receive a reading outside this range, you will need a replacement thermistor.  We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know."

We have researched the model and would suggest checking the wiring connections of the newly installed evaporator fan motor and making sure the evaporator coils are clean. If the issue remains, the problem might be with the temperature sensor, part number PS304103.

                "question": "Out of no where the inside of my refrigerator both freezer and cooler is permitting a chemical over some compare to a nail polish smell. Could this be a evaporated fan failure or something else? By the way, the freezer and cooler are still cooling. The cooler part could be a bit colder but the refrigerator from day one was weak at cooling. This refridgerator is only  a couple years old.  Thanks",
                "answer": "Hello Christine, thank you for your question. That smell is indicative of a Freon leak in the unit. Freon has been can be a very pungent ozone or gasoline smell as well as smelling like nail polish. The amount of Freon contained in the cooling systems of appliances is regulated to be at safe levels, and shouldn't present a threat to your health, but if your sense of scent is sensitive, the Freon smell can be overwhelming. Addressing the issue is as simple as finding the part of the fridge causing the leak. However, leaked Freon needs to be replaced by a technician. In the meantime, open some widows to allow the scent to dissipate. For safety's sake, unplug and scoot the machine out from the wall to gain access to its back or underside, whichever is the location of the coolant tubes that channel Freon throughout the unit. Empty the contents of the fridge and position yourself where the coolant pipes are. In some cases, depending on your model, these pipes are located underneath the unit, at which point you can tilt it back against the wall. Check your fridge's manual for the exact location. The best way to ascertain the location of the leak is to use your nose; wherever the nail polish smell is strongest, it is a sure bet that the leak is nearby. Use a flashlight if need be to find a nick, cut or fraying in one of the hoses. Once you find the leak, use a patch kit designed for repairing cooling hoses. These kits can be purchased at many hardware stores. However, these kits are only meant to serve as a temporary solution; you'll need a professional's advice concerning the extent of the leak and replacing Freon levels. In most states and jurisdictions, it is unlawful (not to mention dangerous) for non-licensed persons to obtain Freon. For this reason, only a licensed repair person should be contacted concerning the leak as well as restoring the appliance's Freon levels to standard levels; if this is not done, your unit won't cool your food to safe temperatures. I hope this helps!"

It does this with the goal of cooling the warm refrigerant before it enters the evaporator. When your fan or fan motor is not working your refrigerator will not cool properly. This is a 2-Watt, 115 Volt motor that rotates the fan in a counter clockwise direction. This kit includes the hardware needed for installation, and a set of instructions. Before you begin any repair work make sure to unplug your appliance.",

In the evening when the room is dark you can put a flash light in the fridge and see if there is any light coming through once the door is closed. If you see light then the gasket will need to be replaced. If the gasket is fine you can check the Evaporator Fan Motor at the back of the freezer. This part pulls air into the evaporator coils and then disperses the air in a continuous motion throughout the refrigerator and freezer.If this is not working then the cold air is not flowing in to the fridge section as it should. It can get build up of dust and dirt over time and sometimes needs a cleaning so the fan it working properly. Since you are back there it sometimes help to vacuum off the coils! \n\nHope this helps!"

                "answer": "Hi Mary,\nThank you for your inquiry.  Based on what you described, the reason why there may be ice building up on the bottom of the refrigerator is the refrigerator is cycling too often, it's leaking water or there is ice buildup in the freezer.  If it is cycling too often then there is probably a build-up of dust on the condenser coils and they will need to be cleaned or the temperature in the refrigerator is set too low.  If it is set too low, you will need to adjust the temperature.  If you have leaking water in your refrigerator you may have a blocked drain caused by food particles or other debris.  Try to flush the drain with warm water through a funnel.  The water tubing may also be clogged and you may have to clean it.  If there is ice buildup in the freezer, it may be caused by leaving the freezer door open allowing the humidity inside to increase.  Try not to leave the freezer door open any longer than it should be.  There may also be an issue with the freezer door gasket and you will need to replace it.  I hope this helps.

If your refrigerator isn't keeping as cool as it should and you feel like the fans are running more than they should you could have a freon problem or a condenser fan motor gone bad. A good way to tell if the condenser fan is not working is to check the area when the compressor is running. If the compressor is running but the fan is not, the fan would need to be replaced.

        "description": "The function of the Refrigerator Water Inlet Valve (Triple Solenoid Water-Valve, Water Valve, Water Inlet Valve, Refrigerator Water Inlet Valve Assembly) is to release water from the supply line when activated, and send it through to your water dispenser or ice maker in your refrigerator. The water inlet valve is located at the back of the refrigerator, and connects to the water supply. The valve can break from material fatigue or normal use. If your water inlet valve is malfunctioning, you could be getting a lack of water to the inside of your refrigerator. Your ice maker may not produce cubes or your water dispenser may not work. The water inlet valve must be replaced if the solenoids no longer have continuity or the valve has internal blockage. This valve measures approximately 7 inches long and 4.5 inches wide, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in blue, and includes the valve and mounting bracket.",

                "question": "Ice maker works but no water out of front. Took apart and actuator is clicking against the electronic part like its supposed to.  How can i be sure the issue is the inlet valve before i spend $50 on it?",
                "answer": "Hi Brian,\nThank you for your question.  To verify if the water inlet valve is causing the issue, you will need to test it with a multimeter.  Before you begin to test your icemaker's water inlet valve, make sure you disconnect the appliance's power supply. The easiest way to do this is to unplug the unit from the wall. Alternatively, you could trip the appropriate switch in the circuit breaker panel, or you could remove the appropriate fuse from your home's fuse box.  Consult with an appliance repair technician if you do not feel you have the skill or the ability to successfully complete this test.  Locate your icemaker's water inlet valve, it is typically located behind a refrigerator. Gently pull your refrigerator away from the wall. You may want to place scraps of carpet, of some other soft material below the fridge to prevent damage to the floor. Turn of the water valve's water supply by closing the shut-off valve in the waterline leading to the water valve. Remove the lower access panel on the back of the refrigerator using a screwdriver or a nut driver.  Place a container under the valve to catch any water that may spill from the water valve and its fill tube. Remove the water valve's fill tubing. Loosen the flare nut on the brass fitting that is found on the inlet side of the water valve. You can use a wrench to loosen the flare nut.  Your water inlet valve is held in place on your refrigerator by means of a metal bracket. Use a screwdriver or a nutdriver to remove the screw that holds the water valve's bracket to the refrigerator cabinet. Gently pull the water valve out of the cabinet, and remove the tube from the outlet port.  There are two wires connecting to the terminals of your water inlet valve. If yours is a double solenoid water valve, it will have four wires. Be sure to label each wire so that you know where to reconnect them later. Firmly grasp the metal connector of the wires in order to remove the wires. You may need to use a pair of needle-nosed pliers. Do not pull on the wires themselves.\nSet your multitester to the R X 1 ohms setting to test for continuity. Place each of the multitester's leads on a terminal. Your multitester should display a reading between 200 and 500 ohms. Closely examine your water inlet valve. The exact ohm resistance rating you should test for may be marked on the valve.  If the test you conduct with your icemaker water inlet valve does not produce these results, then you should replace the component.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

                "answer": "Hi Jacques,\n\nThank you for your question. You can test the solenoids on your valve with a multi meter. When testing your part, your solenoids should read any where between 500 and 1500 ohms of resistance. If it does not, or if your meter numbers do not shift at all, then you will need to replace your part. Good luck with your repair."

The most common issue would be the water inlet valve becoming stuck open and not closing properly and causing the ice maker to over flow. Sounds like your valve is defective and needs to be replaced.

This part is located at the back of the refrigerator, and connects to the water supply.  If your water inlet valve is malfunctioning, you could be getting a lack of water to the inside of your refrigerator. Your ice maker may not produce cubes or your water dispenser may not work. This breakage can occur from material fatigue or normal use, and is a sign the part should be replaced soon. The water inlet valve must be replaced if the solenoids no longer have continuity or the valve has internal blockage. The part measures approximately 6.5 inches long and 3 inches wide and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in blue/green/red.",

I forgot to mention that next to the on/off switch for the ice maker, there is a red flashing light.  I noticed that someone in their question said something about this light - but didn't explain what it means.  Could the red flashing light tell us something about our ice maker not working?  Thanks again!  I really appreciate your service.  Kathy",
                "answer": "Hi Kathy, Thank you for the question. The red light is for the Emitter and Receiver Boards. These boards tell the ice maker to fill and dump ice and when it is time to make more.To test the board you need to open the freezer door and look at the status LED on the right hand side. Make sure the ice maker control is turned “ON”. The status LED should blink twice, pause, and then repeat,blink blink…. pause, blink blink… pause.Next with the freezer door open, hold down the flapper door on the left side to unblock the optics beam. With the optics unblocked, the LED should light up and stay lit with no blinking. If the status LED continues to blink twice , then you have defective optic boards and they will need to be replaced.If there is no LED light on, then the ice maker could be in “harvest” mode. Hold down the freezer light switch, the status LED should flash every second while in harvest mode. If the LED light still does not flash, then the optic control boards will need to be replaced. Hope this helps!"

                "answer": "Hello Butch, thank you for contacting us. It is common over time for the water valve to become faulty and not be able to hold back the water pressure from the home causing some leaks, It may need to be replaced to fix the leak. Hope this helps!"

                "question": "How do you check solenoids on water valve?",
                "answer": "Hello Keith, thank you for contacting us. There are two solenoids on the water valve. These solenoids are sometimes referred to as coils. There will be two wires attached to each solenoid. Be sure to label each of the wires so that you are able to properly reconnect them later. These wires are held in place with metal slip on connectors. Grasp firmly on each connector, one at a time, to disconnect the wire from the solenoid. Do not pull directly on the wire, pull from the metal connector.\nSet your multitester to the ohms resistance scale X 1. Place each of the meter's probes to one terminal. Because the reading can vary from brand to brand and from model to model, there is no one reading you should receive. However, if your test produces a reading of infinity, then the solenoid is bad and the water valve should be replaced."

Perhaps a defective replacement valve or could there be another part causing the issue? Ice maker functions properly without any problems and the rate of flow seems to be unrelated to the filter. Ideas?",
                "answer": "Hello Casey, thank you for your question. The issue could be a defective valve, however it sounds like it may be an issue with the water filter. Have you changed the water filter lately? If not, it might be a good idea to replace that to see if the flow issues are fixed. If the filter has been replaced recently, try removing the filter and reinstalling it to be sure its locked in tight. If the water flow issue continues, i would recommend replacing the Water Dispenser Fitting and Tube Assembly Part Number: PS886371, the Water Dispenser Arm Part Number: WP2180268 as well as the Levers Retainer/Clip Part Number: WP2194719.

                "answer": "Hi Andre,\n\nThank you for your question. There could be an air pocket inside your water line after replacing the filter. If you can, turn off your ice maker and the back on again and see if that will help it push the air pocket out. You may also want to double check your water inlet valve as well. You have two solenoids on your appliance. One for your water and one for your ice maker.  It could be that the solenoid for your ice maker has failed. You can test that with a multi meter. Good luck with your repair."

The most common part that will fix the issue is the water inlet valve.  Some other parts that you will have to look at as well are the water filter, the levers retainer/clip, the water filter housing, the water dispenser fitting and tube assembly, the strain relief, the filter inlet water tube, the ice door kit, the water filter cap, the water reservoir tubing, the ice dispenser door chute, and the water dispenser lever.

Ice maker, ice dispenser and water dispenser all work fine and i can't see a leak as it is small. It takes a couple days for the bottom of the freezer to fill with water and refreeze. It fills up faster if i am making ice or running filtered water, so my guess is that it is leaking while the unit is calling for water.  It doesn't appear to leak when ice/water are not being dispensed",
                "answer": "Hi Jeff,\n\nThank you for your question. The most common parts that cause leaking inside of your freezer are your ice maker and water lines. I would suggest really taking a look at those parts. If it is not that it may be something that you have inside your freezer that is leaking. You could test your thermostat to see if it is working. Perhaps when your freezer is being defrosted, it defrosts too much? If you need more assistance, you may have to contact your manufacturer. Good luck with your repair."

        "description": "If you notice that the ice maker in your refrigerator is leaking or is not making or dispensing ice, you may need to replace the water inlet valve. When energized, the water inlet valve releases water from the supply line into the ice mold. The water inlet valve is in the back of your refrigerator so you will need to pull the fridge out from the wall before completing this repair. To complete this job, you will need a 1/2 inch wrench, a 1/4 inch nut driver and a utility knife. If your old inlet valve has a screw-in fitting, you may need to simply cut the end of the hose to fit in the new part. Be sure to disconnect both the water and power supply from the refrigerator prior to beginning this repair.",

Then it turns off - but then it recycles again before ice is made, and refills with water again and again.  Thus, creating a large block of ice. It doesn't appear to be the water valve - but the icemaker itself is not properly cycling after it dispenses ice cubes.  What do you think?",
                "answer": "Hello John, thank you for your question. It sounds like the water valve is working, as its bringing water up to the unit. However, it may be staying open just a bit, and allowing water to slowly accumulate in the icemaker and then you end up with a  block of ice. I would check to see if you can notice any water coming out of the inlet tube, test the valve, and if that is not the issue the only other possibility would be the icemaker itself. I hope this helps!"

Once you have cut that nut from the end of your water line, you can just push the water line into the water valve. Good luck with your repair."

                "answer": "Hi Jay,\nThank you for your question.  If you have just replaced your water inlet valve, it can take up to 24 hours for the ice maker to start working.  If it is has been more than 24 hours since the ice maker has been installed, then check the water lines and the water filter to see if there are any clogs.  Also, make sure that the water lines are fitted correctly.  If all of this checks out fine, you will need to check the water inlet valve with a multi-meter to see if it is working.  Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and touch the terminals with the probes. You are testing for continuity and should receive a reading of 200 to 500 ohms. If you receive any other reading, you need a replacement water inlet valve. We hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day."

                "answer": "Hi Latorius,\n\nThank you for the great question.Try to pull your ice bin out and check the opening where the gold or brass colored rod enter. There is a solenoid part number PS1483583 inside that should actuate and move the bucket arm in order to dispense cubes. Stick your finger in there and to get it to drop down. The solenoid may be damaged, or just frozen in place. Once it drops down leave the freezer door open, actuate the door switch with your finger, while pressing the ice lever in the dispenser. Make sure you have selected cube. If the solenoid is working will go up then back down when you release the lever. If not, then you will need to remove the housing  and see if it is full of frost. The solenoid shaft must move freely in order to work properly. They can also rust with time and prevent the free movement. \n\nHope this helps!"

                "answer": "Hi Robert,\n\nThank you for your inquiry. It actually could be either of those parts. What I would suggest is that you test them with a multi-meter and see if either of them are malfunctioning. Usually it is more likely that the dispenser solenoid is the problem, however you can test them to make sure. I hope this helps!"

                "answer": "Hi Art,\n\nThank you for your question. It could be your solenoid. I would suggest also just taking a quick look at the spring and the housing that holds your door. Sometimes it is just a simple break in a piece there that will keep that door from closing properly. If you do not see any physical damage, you can test your solenoid to see if it is broken or not with a multi meter. The price of the part is up above in the part information. Good luck with your repair."

Yes, if the water valve is dispensing water without pressing the switch, and you have already changed the micro switch, I would recommend replacing the water valve. If the water valve is stuck open the water will continue to dispense. I hope this helps!"

                "answer": "Hi Chris,\nThank you for your question.  If the solenoid assembly is freezing or rusting, make sure that the dispenser door is closing and sealing properly.   Also, check to see if there is frost build-up, by removing the ice bin.  If the solenoid is rusting, there may be some spillage or splash from the water dispenser.  Try using a thin coat of vegetable oil on the dispenser door to help prevent the door from rusting.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

                "answer": "Hi Russell,\n\nThank you for your inquiry. That could just be the water that is still in the line. I would suggest testing your water inlet valve to see if it is working correctly. Otherwise you might have to look at your water line and see if there is a leak somewhere. Good luck with your repair."

Is it the solenoid or maybe something else.Also our ice makes more ice than we use in any given day. I usually bag it and put it in the deep freeze. It seems to freeze up around the end where the blades are and where the rod is in the back.How can i adjust it to make less ice. Please help .",
                "answer": "Hello Glenda, Thank you for your inquiry. I would test your water inlet valve and ice maker for continuity to see if too much water is going to the ice maker. Too much ice buildup can also clog the dispenser flap and make it so that only the crushed ice is getting through and not the bigger cubes. Try taking the bucket out and checking for any obstructions and clearing any trapped ice away. You can test the valve with a multimeter. There are also tests online for your ice maker as well. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, there are YouTube videos available to assist you. Hope this helps!"

                "question": "When water or ice is dispensed the chute does not automatically close",
                "answer": "Hi Carmen,\nThank you for your question.  If the chute is not closing after the water or ice is dispensed, the issue may be with the actuator or the micro switch.  The actuator is a possible option when ice door won't open or shut properly or when water or is not dispensing. The switch helps control the functions of the dispenser and you may want to test the micro switch with a multimeter to check for electrical continuity, and replace it if it shows no continuity. Also examine the water tank and and the water line connectors for any signs of wear and tear. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "description": "This “Dispenser Door Assembly” (Door Recess Assembly, Ice Door Assembly, Dispenser Door, Refrigerator Dispenser Ice Chute Door Kit, Dispenser Door Flap, Ice Chute Door, Flapper) keeps the room air from infiltrating the freezer.  Once the lever is pressed, the door flap opens and allows the ice to dispense into your container. If your door flapper is broken, it could allow outside air to enter the freezer and alter the inside temperature. You may notice frost buildup surrounding the dispenser area. The door flap can disconnect from the dispenser lever, or the tabs that hold it in place may break. Frequent use may distort the sealing face and cause air leaks and frost buildup. This part mounts in the ice dispenser, and measures approximately 3.25 inches in diameter. It is constructed of plastic and rubber, and comes in white/black. This part is sold individually.",

What i need to know now is replacing the flap going to fix the problem or do i need to replace what closes the flap",
                "answer": "Hi Diane,\n\nThank you for your question. That flap seals your freezer from the outside. The only thing I can think of is because it is not sealing, moisture is getting in from the outside and freezing around your opening. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

Warm air is getting up inside the dispenser and frosting and freezing. You may also want to replace the Dispenser Door Recess Crank Part Number: PS291908 and Recess Door Spring Part Number: PS285013 at the same time. Good luck with your repair!"

I order a new flapper.I also have inconsistent dripping coming from where the water comes out.If I dispense more water it will stop.I don't believe this has to do with the faulty flapper because it comes out the white tube.  What could the issue be?",
                "answer": "Hi Brian, Thank you for the question. I suggest replacing the Dual Inlet Water Valve,PartSelect Number: PS304374.If the valve is defective it will become \"stuck\" open and allow water to flow through creating the dripping.It can also cause the water to sit in the tubing and cause the freezing. Hope this helps!"

The part number for the water filter is PS8746144 you may also need the adapter if you have not changed it before, part number PS220347. Hope this helps!"

If your handle is visibly broken then it should be replaced. Refer to your model number, and user manual to see if this part is right for you. These door handles are not sold individually, so we recommend replacing both handles at one time, or keeping the second one as a spare in case of future repairs. If you require the mounting blocks for the handle, these are sold separately. To make the repair, simply remove the screws at the top of the lower door, and replace the handle, screwing it into place.",

If your current refrigerator door handles for your fridge or freezer compartments are missing, damaged, unsightly, or unable to pull the door, they will need replacing. To replace a door handle, unthread the screw securing its top and slide it down to release, then slide the new handle on and secure its top. This set includes two OEM door handles, but does not include their securing screws, which are instead sold separately.",

The function of the p-trap drain kit is to carry the water that has formed during the defrost cycle to the bottom of the refrigerator, where your drain pan is located. The tools you will need for this repair include a 1/4-inch nut driver and a small flat-blade screwdriver. To do this repair you will need to pull the refrigerator forward in order to reach the lower access panel at the back. This kit includes the tube extension piece and spacer.",

                "answer": "Hi Philip, thank you for your question. It could if that is what the issue is. When you are having temperature problems in your fridge, there are a few parts that could cause the issue. You can use a multi meter to test most of the parts. Make sure you cut power to your appliance before doing any repairs or tests. First you should test your defrost thermostat. Place the thermostat in ice cold water for 2-3 minutes after removing it from your appliance. It should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. Another part to check would be your defrost heater. Remove it from the appliance. It should be reading anywhere between 0 - 50 ohms to be working. You could check your temperature sensor. To find the correct reading for this part you will have to refer to your tech sheet that comes with your appliance. You can usually find this tech sheet behind the bottom grille of your fridge on either the right or left side. These are the most common parts that cause this issue in your appliance. So it is suggested you check them first. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

I was going to order one from you but want to be sure i won't have the same problem. In comparing both drains on line they seem identical.Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n thanks,\n  ed",

If the there is ice buildup at the drain tube, there is likely debris in it preventing water from draining.  The water will pool on the floor and then freeze. The drain tube will need to be either cleaned out or if it is damaged, it will need to be replaced.

I came to this website and saw that this was quite a common problem and generally fixed by replacing the P trap. I ordered the part and replaced the P trap as per the video (thank you for that!). After one week I see that ice has begun to build up again on the freezer floor so it doesn’t appear the replacement P trap has fixed the problem. It hasn’t leaked out yet but I’m guessing it’s just a matter of time. What would you suggest is wrong? What would be my next step be that I could do myself instead of calling a repair man. The appliance is 10 years old. Thank you.",

Sometimes dehumidification of leaking warm air can cause the issue of ice build-up and leaking. It also looks like your refrigerator is not defrosting properly. We would recommend checking the defrost thermostat, part number PS11743535, and the defrost heater, part number PS11738606. Please also ensure that the drip pan, part number PS11756973, is not damaged and is placed correctly. Please reach out to customer service if you need help placing an order. Glad to be of help!"

We have researched your model number and found that most of the time ice builds up in the freezer's bottom section if the door is not properly closed and the cool air in the freezer can combine with the warm and humid air from the outside. If the doors do not close properly, ensure that the door seal on the edge of the door is attached properly. If the door gasket doesn’t close properly, ice can build up in your freezer. The gasket needs to be cleaned regularly to avoid ice build-up. Sometimes the drain in your freezer can get blocked or frozen, which will cause an excess of water at the bottom of your freezer, which will turn into ice. You can unblock the drain by pouring hot water down it. Please submit a new question if you have any follow-ups."

        "description": "This Defrost Timer works like a clock by switching on the defrost heater circuit after a predetermined amount of compressor run time. This allows the defrost circuit to clear the evaporator of ice or frost to maintain proper airflow. The defrost timer is located in the control housing which is in the refrigerator section of your appliance. If this part is not working, it can lead to temperature increases in your refrigerator. If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced. This timer measures approximately 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in black/white/silver and is sold individually. This replacement part features 1 defrost timer.",

                "question": "First, the fridge was warm and the freezer was working and was iced in the back. I unplugged it and let it defrost. I took the back off the inside of the freezer to visually check the defrost thermostat. It looked ok. I put the back on again and plugged it in. The light came on in the fridge, but the refrigerator did not start running. Does this mean it is done for and I need a new fridge?",
                "answer": "Hi Terri,\n\nThank you for the question. Sounds like you need to replace the Defrost Timer. Defrost timers are part of the defrost circuit in your refrigerator and freezer. This timer cycles the defrost heater on and off. For every eight hours, the appliance timer will cycle for 30 minutes. The defrost heater is what melts the frost buildup on the evaporator coils, and it can prevent your freezer from frosting up. If your timer fails, the heater will not get the energy it needs to run, and frost will continue to build up and can cause the temperature in the fridge to rise. \n\n\nHope this helps!"

                "answer": "Hi Terri,\n\nThank you for the question. You can test the defrost thermostat and the defrost heater with a multi-meter. If they are in working order it is likely that the defrost timer is the faulty.\n\nIt is also a good idea to check the door gasket. When the room is dark, you can put a flash light into the fridge and close the door and see if there is light coming through anywhere around the gasket. \n\nHope this helps!"

You may need to open the door and remove the kick plate grill. Down in the bottom corner on the left side there will be a cover you can remove to expose the timer. \n\nHope this helps!"

Since i cannot find the copy of the manual for this refrigerator-freezer (14.2 cubic feet).  Also, i have noticed that the freezer does not run as often as before and appears to be a bit warm. Please inform me as to what the problem may be or should i start thinking about buying another refrigerator-freezer. Thanks for your help.      Michael",
                "answer": "Hello Michael, thank you for contacting us. The fridge components may just need a good cleaning. The coils at the back of the fridge by the compressor and condenser fan should be clean of all dust or debris. You can also remove the panel in the freezer to make sure the coils in there are not iced up, while you have that off you can make sure the evaporator fan is working properly, as that is what circulates the cool air into the fridge. It could also be as you mentioned, the defrost timer or the thermostat. The thermostat can be tested with a multi-meter. Hope this helps!"

You will want to test the defrost thermostat and the temperature control thermostat with a multimeter for electrical continuity. Replace them if they do not show continuity.\n\nI hope this helps."

If the leaking is coming from underneath your refrigerator I would suggest first checking the drain pan for cracks or if it is over filling. If it is over filling then you may need to take a look at the defrost thermostat and heater in your appliance. You may also want to look at your water lines and your water inlet valve and make sure that they are not the parts causing your leaking. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

We would recommend checking the damper, Damper Control Assembly Part Number: PS11750106, to be sure its opening enough to allow the air into the fridge from the freezer. If the damper and damper motor and opening and closing properly, the issue is probably the electronic board, PartSelect Number PS11755733,  which would have to be replaced. I hope this helps!"

        "description": "The Defrost Timer (Defrost control) acts like a clock by switching on the defrost heater circuit after a predetermined amount of compressor run time. This allows the defrost circuit to clear the evaporator of ice or frost to maintain proper airflow. If this part is not working, it can lead to temperature increases in your refrigerator. If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced. This part is located inside of the control housing on most models, and is approximately 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide. This part is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in white. It features 1 defrost timer, along with all necessary mounting hardware and installation instructions",

If you have have already replaced the bi-metal defrost thermostat and the defrost timer, there are some other parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.

We would recommend checking the following parts to fix your issue: the evaporator fan motor, the condenser fan motor, the damper control, the defrost timer, the defrost thermostat, and the cold control thermostat. You can test the parts with a multimeter. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, there are YouTube videos available to assist you. Hope this helps!"

                "answer": "Hi Jeffrey, Thank you for the question. This sounds like a defective Thermostat Assembly. I suggest testing the Thermostat with a multi meter to check for resistance. You can also test the Bi-Metal Defrost Thermostat.The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps!"

                "answer": "Hi Mario,\nThank you for your inquiry.  If your fridge and freezer section are too warm, the majority of the time it is the capacitor that fixes the issue.  Another part you may have to check is the evaporator fan motor.  To verify which part is causing the issue you will need to use a multimeter.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

You can use a multi meter to test most of the parts. Make sure you cut power to your appliance before doing any repairs or tests. First you should test your defrost thermostat. Place the thermostat in ice cold water for 2-3 minutes after removing it from your appliance. It should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. Another part to check would be your defrost heater. Remove it from the appliance. It should be reading anywhere between 0 - 50 ohms to be working. You could check your temperature sensor. To find the correct reading for this part you will have to refer to your tech sheet that comes with your appliance. You can usually find this tech sheet behind the bottom grille of your fridge on either the right or left side. These are the most common parts that cause this issue in your appliance. So it is suggested you check them first. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

It allows the compressor in your appliance to easily cycle on and off. This capacitor mounts directly onto the compressor starting relay. If the capacitor is faulty the compressor may get unusually hot and draw excessive amperage. It the compressor overheats, it may fail to run until it cools down again. The compressor may also get noisy from overheating.  If this part is totally electrically open, it is defective (often due to overheating) and needs to be replaced. The part measures 1 inch by 1-1/2 inches, and is constructed of plastic with two metal wire terminals. This item includes 1 capacitor, sold individually. This part comes in black.",

It is good to make sure this fan is still running so it is blowing the cool air to the fresh food side of the appliance from the freezer. Also make sure the fan blades are clean and the coils on the back of the appliance are clean. They can have dust build up over time so it is a good idea to give them a good vacuuming. \n\nWe also suggest the gasket around the door is properly sealing and not letting in any warm air. \n\nIf all these areas seem ok then you may need to replace the Thermostat.\n\nHope this helps!"

I would actually suggest testing both your run capacitor, your freezer thermistor, and your defrost thermostat first. Those are the more likely parts to be the problem. You can test all three of those with a multi meter to be sure they are working correctly. If they are, then you might have to look into your board being the issue. I hope that helps.

Set the meter to read in the high ohms range, somewhere above 10k and 1m ohms. Touch the meter leads to the corresponding leads on the capacitor, red to positive and black to negative. The meter should start at zero and then moving slowly toward infinity. Hope this helps!"

You may need to replace your run capacitor if your refrigerator or freezer section will not start, if they are too warm, or if your refrigerator has become too noisy. Replacing the run capacitor is a relatively easy project. For this repair you will only need a 1/4 inch nut driver and needle nose pliers. Remember to disconnect the power and water supply line to the unit before you begin this repair. For full step by step instructions, simply click on the video below.",

                "answer": "Hi William,\n\nThank you for your inquiry. You can test both of those parts with a multi-meter. Make sure after unplugging your capacitor you release any electrical charge. You can do this with a screwdriver that has an insulated handle. When testing your capacitor set your meter to 1000 ohms. If your meter stays on 0 then your capacitor needs to be replaced. For your start relay, set your meter to the lowest setting and calibrate it to 0. Your relay should be reading anywhere between 10 - 100 ohms. If it does not, then it is likely broken and needs to be replace. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

                "answer": "Hello Ted, thank you for your question. The run capacitor helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature in your fridge and freezer.  Usually if the run capacitor goes bad the unit will not start at all. However, it is possible that it will run too often. In your case, the unit is running too much, which usually means the compressor is being signaled to start more often than it should. So, to determine the faulty part, there are some parts that you will want to check in regards to this issue. The Run Capacitor Part Number: 5304464438,  the Defrost Thermostat Kit Part Number: 5303918214, the Temperature Control Part Number: 241537104 and Temperature Control Thermostat Part Number: 5304496561 and the Adaptive Defrost Control Board Part Number: 5303918476. There is some great information in regards to this issue at the following link, including testing information. I hope this helps!\n\nhttps://www.partselect.com/Repair/Refrigerator/Running-Too-Long/"

                "answer": "Hi James,\n\nThank you for the great question. We recommend starting with the Defrost Thermostat Kit. It is pretty common with previous customers when the temperature would rise. If you are not able to test the thermostat with a multi meter it is a pretty in expensive part and might be worth installing a new one to see if it fixes the issue. \n\nHope this helps!"

I have restarted the unit and alarm cam clear and ran fine for a couple days but now it's in again. The relay clicks on and off on the controller board do u think it's the starter capacitor or the board?",

The Frigidaire refrigerator Error Code SY CE: Communication error during powering up. – This error indicates a problem with wiring to and from the main control board and the user interface board. – Error can also mean the main control board or user interface board (display board) is defective or faulty.   To verify what part may be causing the issue you may use an Ohms/Multi-meter to check the continuity of the parts.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and a have a great day!"

                "answer": "Hi Danny, Thank you for the question. I suggest testing the Defrost Thermostat Kit.The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps!"

                "answer": "Hello James,\n\nThanks for your question. Due to the clicking noise, we suspect that the problem would be your compressor. Use a multi-meter to test the compressor for continuity, along with the start relay and run capacitor, and replace any of these parts if they are not showing continuity. Only a licensed technician should replace the compressor if that is the issue.\n\nI hope this helps."

I replaced that, then a couple months ago the fridge would start beeping (4-beep intervals, we think), and fridge temp would read too warm. Unplugging the fridge would clear these. It started happening more frequently about a week ago, and we noticed the freezer getting warmer, ice and popsicles weren't staying frozen, then the water dispenser quit working. Now the fridge has stopped cooling completely and both fridge and freezer read 60 degrees. Advice?",
                "answer": "Hi Stacy, Thank you for the question. The board might need to be reset. Unplug your refrigerator from the outlet, and open there door for about 5 minutes.

My question: If the run capacitor is bad, will the refrigerator and freezer still work, because they are fine. Could the run capacitor be the culprit for the icemaker not working? Thank you!",

You may need to replace your run capacitor if your refrigerator or freezer section will not start, if they are too warm, or if your refrigerator has become too noisy.  If your ice maker is not working, check the arm to see if it is in the correct position, if you have tried replacing the other parts and nothing worked, you may have to replace the complete ice maker.

        "description": "This crisper pan roller is sourced directly from the manufacturer for use in your refrigerator. It is a genuine OEM part that is designed to fit just like the original for your convenience. The roller is a plastic wheel-like component that attached to the sides of the crisper pan and allows it slide in and out of the refrigerator smoothly. The rollers allow users to easily and conveniently access the contents of the drawers. Over time, the roller may wear down, break, or fall off. If the roller is faulty, you may notice difficulty sliding the drawer in and out, or the drawer may feel loose and unstable when you pull it out. Each crisper pan roller is sold individually. Ensure that you order the correct number of rollers for your refrigerator.",

You have changed most of the major parts that I would think you would have to check. I would also suggest checking your gaskets to see if they are sealing correctly. If your gaskets look fine then you will probably have to look into seeing if there is an issue with your main control board. I hope this helps. Good luck with your repair."

Open the freezer door and remove all of the shelves, followed by the light shield and the bulb. Take out the two screws that hold the top edge of the back panel, then the ground wire clip that attaches to the back panel. Pull out the left side of the panel and remove it. You may want to remove the bottom drawer as well. Remove the screws retaining the defrost heater assembly and pull it out slightly. Remove the two wires at the side of the heater. Reverse this procedure to install the new part.\n\nI hope this helps."

                "answer": "Hi Dan, Thank you for the question. I suggest testing the Defrost Thermostat.The best way to do this is to remove the Thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps!"

I now have prob with refrigerator not being cold enough over past few days and now the water dispenser not working. I haven't been able to take everything out of the freezer yet to look. But can a bad defrost heater element  cause the water to stop dispensing if it has caused the coils behind the big panel of freezer to ice up? Thanks",

If the refrigerator section is too warm, the defrost heater and bracket is one part you will need to check, but there are some other parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the temperature sensor, the dc condenser fan motor, the compression ring, the evaporator fan blade, the dispenser door assembly or flapper, the fresh food door gasket, the inverter kit with jumpers, the evaporator thermistor clip and the defrost thermostat.

                "answer": "Hi Jean,\nThank you for your question.  If the space between the doors is warmer than normal, there is an issue with air flow over the coils.  You will need to clean the condenser coils. When your condensor coils are clogged up, the heat gets trapped.  This causes your condensor fan to run constantly where it may become damaged or cause it to stop working.  The fan blade may also become damaged.  This extended use can also lead to damage to the fan blade itself like warping or breaks.  If you notice that you no longer hear the fan running, the first thing you will  want to check is that the fan blade is intact and clear of any blockages.  If it seems to be working normally, you’ll need to test that the motor is not damaged, and replace if needed.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

                "answer": "Hello Blair, Thank you for the question. I suggest first checking the Evaporator Fan Motor at the back of the freezer. PartSelect Number PS304600. The fan  circulates air over the refrigerator coils. These coils will convert the heat into cool air, which is then circulated to the Fresh Food Section to keep it cool. If the fan is running normally you can check the Defrost Thermostat, PartSelect Number PS303471. The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps!"

It acts like a clock by switching between activating the cooling cycle and the defrost heater to maintain the set thermostat temperature, preventing the unit from being too warm or cold. The defrost timer may need to be replaced if the fridge will not maintain its temperature or has frost buildup. Depending on the model, it could be located on the rear panel or ceiling of the fresh food compartment. Be sure to disconnect power to the refrigerator before replacing this part.",

                "answer": "Hello Jerry, Thank you for the question. I suggest testing the Defrost Thermostat,  PartSelect Number PS2350702. The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps!"

        "description": "This Defrost Timer works like a clock by switching on the defrost heater circuit after a predetermined amount of compressor run time. This allows the defrost circuit to clear the evaporator of ice or frost to maintain proper airflow. The defrost timer is located in the control housing which is in the refrigerator section of your appliance. If this part is not working, it can lead to temperature increases in your refrigerator. If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced. This timer measures approximately 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in black/white/silver and is sold individually. This replacement part features 1 defrost timer.",

                "question": "First, the fridge was warm and the freezer was working and was iced in the back. I unplugged it and let it defrost. I took the back off the inside of the freezer to visually check the defrost thermostat. It looked ok. I put the back on again and plugged it in. The light came on in the fridge, but the refrigerator did not start running. Does this mean it is done for and I need a new fridge?",
                "answer": "Hi Terri,\n\nThank you for the question. Sounds like you need to replace the Defrost Timer. Defrost timers are part of the defrost circuit in your refrigerator and freezer. This timer cycles the defrost heater on and off. For every eight hours, the appliance timer will cycle for 30 minutes. The defrost heater is what melts the frost buildup on the evaporator coils, and it can prevent your freezer from frosting up. If your timer fails, the heater will not get the energy it needs to run, and frost will continue to build up and can cause the temperature in the fridge to rise. \n\n\nHope this helps!"

                "answer": "Hi Terri,\n\nThank you for the question. You can test the defrost thermostat and the defrost heater with a multi-meter. If they are in working order it is likely that the defrost timer is the faulty.\n\nIt is also a good idea to check the door gasket. When the room is dark, you can put a flash light into the fridge and close the door and see if there is light coming through anywhere around the gasket. \n\nHope this helps!"

You may need to open the door and remove the kick plate grill. Down in the bottom corner on the left side there will be a cover you can remove to expose the timer. \n\nHope this helps!"

For the last several days, i have noticed that some water comes out from the screws on the left side of the freezer particularly when i open the freezer widely. Since i cannot find the copy of the manual for this refrigerator-freezer (14.2 cubic feet).  Also, i have noticed that the freezer does not run as often as before and appears to be a bit warm. Please inform me as to what the problem may be or should i start thinking about buying another refrigerator-freezer. Thanks for your help.      Michael",
                "answer": "Hello Michael, thank you for contacting us. The fridge components may just need a good cleaning. The coils at the back of the fridge by the compressor and condenser fan should be clean of all dust or debris. You can also remove the panel in the freezer to make sure the coils in there are not iced up, while you have that off you can make sure the evaporator fan is working properly, as that is what circulates the cool air into the fridge. It could also be as you mentioned, the defrost timer or the thermostat. The thermostat can be tested with a multi-meter. Hope this helps!"

There could be a couple of parts causing your issue but because warmth is happening in both your fridge and freezer sections, I would suggest testing your defrost timer, your defrost thermostat, your run capacitor, and your start relay as well.

If the appliance runs to long I suggest replacing the Run Capacitor,PartSelect Number PS2333670.The run capacitor helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature in your fridge and freezer.

You will want to test the defrost thermostat and the temperature control thermostat with a multimeter for electrical continuity. Replace them if they do not show continuity.\n\nI hope this helps."

If the leaking is coming from underneath your refrigerator I would suggest first checking the drain pan for cracks or if it is over filling. If it is over filling then you may need to take a look at the defrost thermostat and heater in your appliance. You may also want to look at your water lines and your water inlet valve and make sure that they are not the parts causing your leaking. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

The plastic clips that held the switches on the control bracket broke so that the switches no longer operated when the ice dispenser lever was operated. \n\nTwo screws held the external dispenser bezel, and two screws held the control bracket in place. The wiring and switches were transferred to the new bracket and the new bracket screwed into place. Then the bezel was replaced.\n\nTotal repair time was less than 5 minutes. The control bracket was $16.50 with shipping and arrived two days after I placed the order.\n\nThe PartSelect website had a clear diagram of the control bracket so I was comfortable with the order.\"  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

                "answer": "Hi Ken, Thank you for the question. You first need to check to see if the water valve at the back of the appliance is releasing water. If the ice maker is making ice but not dispensing you need to replace the Dispenser Switch, Part number PS11739028. If the ice maker is not filling with water to make ice, you would need to look at the Water Valve, PartSelect Number: PS11731255. Hope this helps!"

                "answer": "Hi Kenneth,\nThank you for your question.  To remove the front cover from the door, you will need to use a flat head screw diver along the bottom corners to allow it snap out.  There is a video on our website that you can reference on how to remove the front cover.  The refrigerator in the video may not show exactly like the one you have and the part being installed is an actuator, but it will give you a general idea on how to remove the part.  You will find the video under part number PS1526381.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

What would be wrong with the control bracket to look for as to why my water would not be working? I have not replaced the water control valve because it is still pumping for the ice maker. Any advice? Thanks",
                "answer": "Hello Ronald, Thank you for the question. If the bracket is the issue, you will see physical damage to the bracket. The valve has two solenoids, one for the water dispenser and one for the Ice maker. I suggest testing the solenoids with a multimeter. There are two solenoids on the water valve. These solenoids are sometimes referred to as coils. There will be two wires attached to each solenoid. Be sure to label each of the wires so that you are able to properly reconnect them later. These wires are held in place with metal slip on connectors. Grasp firmly on each connector, one at a time, to disconnect the wire from the solenoid. Do not pull directly on the wire, pull from the metal connector. Set your multi meter to the ohms resistance scale X 1. Place each of the meter's probes to one terminal. Because the reading can vary from brand to brand and from model to model, there is no one reading you should receive. However, if your test produces a reading of infinity, then the solenoid is bad and the water valve should be replaced. Hope this helps!"

The cooling of the gas causes a reduction in pressure inside the freezer, resulting in a partial vacuum that makes the door more difficult to open. However, a domestic freezer is not perfectly sealed and air will slowly leak in from outside and equalize the pressure. So, after a few minutes, the door becomes easier to open.

The evaporator fan blade circulates air through the refrigerator to control the amount of cold air goes that goes to internal compartments of the unit. It may need to be replaced if the fridge is noisy or not cold enough. This part is made of plastic and is sold individually. It will be necessary to disconnect power to the refrigerator and empty the freezer compartment of the refrigerator. The tools needed to complete this repair are a 1/4 inch nut driver and a pair of needle nose pliers.",

Fridge and freezer are too warm and a clicking sound was being heard,  frost has built up on the bottom half of the freezer panel in this short time.  What would be my next step?",
                "answer": "Hi Pamela, Thank you for the question. With the information provided, you may have an issue with the Main Power Control Board,PartSelect Number: PS2339026.You can also test the Defrost Thermostat.\nThe best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps!"

You will need to check the evaporator fan blade, the evaporator fan motor, the temperature sensor and the filter-drier.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

                "answer": "Hello Clyde, thank you for your question. The fan does not run continuously. It turns on and off to blow cold air into the fridge from the freezer. You're probably hearing the noise when the fan is running. I Would recommend removing the cover on the back of the unit to make sure the blade isn't hitting ice that has built up on the coils. If there is lots of ice buildup you would have a different issue and then we could provide some more information on the potential parts. I hope this helps!"

                "answer": "Hello Joanne, thank you for writing. We advise checking the Run Capacitor. When testing a capacitor with a multimeter, you will need to set the meter between 10K and 1m ohms. Touch the leads from the multimeter to the corresponding leads on the capacitor. The red lead to positive and the black lead to the negative. The meter should start at zero and then moving slowly toward infinity. This means that the capacitor is in working condition. If the meter stays at zero, the capacitor is not charging through the battery of the meter, meaning it is not working. I hope this helps."

If you notice your refrigerator is too warm, too cold, or not defrosting properly, then there may be a problem with your sensor.

You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature or grab a glass of ice water to test the thermistor. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced.\n\nHope this helps!"

It took him quite a while to figure out and believed it was the condensor inverter  and the motherboard (that he said was \"fried\").    He replaced both items (...it took a good part of 2 days...).   it appeared that all was working and both sides of frig were starting to get cold; we had to leave town again.    when we got home 2 days later, both sides were at 72 degrees again.    we called repair guy who was coming the next morning.    when he arrived, all was operating fine, and temps were \"very close\" to their good settings (i.e. freezer @ 0  and  other side @ 35 degrees).     hard to fix something that's working.    we've continued to \"check the temps\" every few hours the past 7 days and all has been ok.   tonight we went to the freezer and everything liquid again (...we haven't put any meat in freezer until we know all ok....).  temps at 45 47 degrees (both sides).   compressor is \"cool to the touch\" (i.e. not running) but fan is running.   i'm thinking that maybe its the temperature sensor(s) causing the problem.       any ideas?   we've already spent $650 on repairs + cost of all food in frig & freezer being lost.   the 36\" GE monogram (counter depth), side by side  is 9 years old.",

I would recommend checking to make sure the evaporator motor is working properly, buy turning the fan blade and pushes the air into the fridge and circulates the around around all the items in the fridge.

                "answer": "Hi Jack,\nThank you for your inquiry.  It is normal for the ice in the bucket to stick or fuse together. This will occur if the ice is not used right away. This can also occur if the water is splashing or leaking during the fill cycle. Adjusting the water to a lower level may also help. If the load in the freezer is less then half full, it can also cause the temperature during the defrost cycle, to get warmer and may cause the ice to fuse together at a faster rate.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

Any suggestions and fix will be helpful.",
                "answer": "Hello Sidney, Thank you for your inquiry. We would recommend checking the following parts to fix your issue: temperature sensor, defrost heater, defrost thermostat, damper control, and the evaporator fan motor. You can test the parts with a multimeter. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, there are YouTube videos available to assist you. Hope this helps!"

This part senses heat from the igniter to monitor if it is hot enough to ignite gas to light the burner. Once the igniter is hot enough it will open the valve and allow gas to flow. This is a safety mechanism to prevent dangerous levels of gas from building up. To repair, the main top of the dryer should be lifted, as well as the front panel to access the component. This flame sensor assembly is made of both plastic and metal.",

                "answer": "Hi Bill,\n\nThank you for your inquiry. You can test your sensor with a multi-meter to see if it is still working. First you will have to disconnect the power to your appliance and then remove the sensor. Second you will set your multi-meter to the lowest setting and then calibrate it to show zero. Take each probe of your meter and touch one to each of the prongs on your sensor. If the meter continues to show zero or infinite ohms, your sensor is bad and needs to be replaced. Good luck with your repair!"

Thank you again...",
                "answer": "Hi Jeff, thank you for your question. Unfortunately no. However you would test all of those parts with a multi meter. Your radiant flame sensor, thermostats, and thermal fuses should be testing 0 ohms to be working. Your igniter should read between 50 - 400 ohms. Your heating element should read between 0 - 50 ohms. You will need to remove all of those parts before testing to have accurate results. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

                "question": "Regarding the advice you offer on testing electrical components with a multi-meter.Testing coils is a good example as digital meters send pulses and analog meters send constant current. Coils react differently to these. Do the numbers you use apply to both digital and analog meters? I figure the ignitor and sensors do not have this (possible) issue. Tyia",
                "answer": "Hi John,\nThank you for your question.  To test a radiant flame sensor, Set a multimeter to the lowest ohms of resistance setting. The sign for ohms looks like a horseshoe, and depending on your model, this setting could be RX1, 200, 2K, or X10. Touch the probes together on an analog meter and rotate the dial on the side of the meter until the needle rest at zero on the far right of the display.  Pull the wire connectors off the flame sensor terminals. Touch one multimeter probe to one of the flame sensor terminals and touch the remaining terminal with the remaining probe. If the needle sweeps to the right and rest at zero on the analog meter, or it the digital meter displays zeros, the flame sensor is good. If your meter displays any other reading, the sensor is bad and must be replaced. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

You can use a multi meter. I would say first test your M series coils, then your thermostats, and then your igniter, and radiant flame sensor. Those are the most common parts to go out. All of them should read 0 ohms when testing them. The igniter however should test anywhere between 50 and 400 ohms of resistance. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

                "answer": "Hi Tracey,\n\nThank you for your inquiry. It could be your sensor, I would suggest also taking a look at your fuse and your thermostats as well. If your fuse is out then your machine will not heat. If your thermostats are not working right they could be reading the wrong temperature and shutting down the machine because it thinks that it is getting too hot. Good luck with your repair."

I have replaced the thermistor and the control damper and fridge still will not maintain a constant temp. When i unplug and plug it back in the fridge will cool back down for a short period of time. But its like when the temp rises and it calls for it to start cooling again it doesn't. Any help greatly appreciated.",
                "answer": "Hello Dave, thank you for contacting us. If the freezer is staying at its proper temp but the fridge is not, that could be the an issue with the evaporator fan or motor. That is what blows the cool air into the fridge. Hope this helps!"

                "answer": "Hi Russ, Thank you for the question. I recommend replacing the Electronic Control Board,PartSelect Number PS11755733.The electronic control board is used in refrigerators to monitor and manage the temperature settings, such as cooling or defrosting times. If your fridge or freezer is too warm, too cold, is not defrosting, will not start, and/or runs too long then replacing the control board could solve your appliance problem.Hope this helps!"

                "answer": "Hello Gary, Thank you for the question. There is no fuse or board, but I suggest testing the Compressor Start Device and Capacitor PartSelect Number PS8746522 with a multi meter. This includes both the run capacitor and the start relay. The capacitor helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature to keep things frozen in your freezer. The start relay boosts the compressor, and then shuts off as soon as the motor gets up to speed and the overload provides extra protection against excessive temperatures. Hope this helps!"

At first this happened once in awhile but now it does it somedays more than once a day.",
                "answer": "Hi Donna,\nThank you for your question.  If your are hearing a ticking or clicking noise from your appliance, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which ones are causing the issue.

If the freezer is working but the fridge is getting too warm, you will want to check to see if the evaporator fan motor is working to push cold air to the fridge from the freezer, as well as the damper is opening and closing to allow more or less air in.  You may also want to check that the coils behind the freezer wall are not frosting over, if they are you may need the defrost control board. If the freezer is also too warm and not cooling enough, the start device and capacitor on the compressor. I hope this helps!"

I suggest testing the Bi-Metal Defrost Thermostat.The best way to do this is to remove the Thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps"

                "answer": "Hello Alan, thank you for your question. We would recommend testing the start device, and capacitor which are on the compressor. You're testing for continuity so if they show continuity when tested they have not failed. The next step would be to test/replace the thermostat. The cold control is a temperature controlled switch that supplies power to the compressor and fan circuits in the refrigerator. If your refrigerator won’t start and no fans are running, then you may have a defective control. The temperature adjustment knob is attached to the control and is normally located in the fresh food section control panel. You can check the control for continuity with a multi-meter. You will need to remove power from the appliance first, remove the control from the housing and disconnect the terminal leads. As you adjust the control to a colder setting the switch should close and you should have continuity between the terminals. If not, then the control is defective and will need to be replaced. I hope this helps!"

                "answer": "Hi Dorothy,\nThank you for your question.  The little black box you are referring to maybe the capacitor, part number PS11757023.  The capacitor is also known as a run capacitor, and it is most often used in refrigerators and freezers. This part provides the voltage or energy current required to start the compressor and keep it running. It allows the compressor in your appliance to easily cycle on and off. Doing so enables the appliance to effortlessly maintain its internal temperature. If the capacitor is faulty your refrigerator or freezer might be too warm, or you may notice the compressor will hum, but it will not run. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

Old, we have been unplugging it and manually defrosting the freezer which quits the compressor noise for a few weeks then it starts to get very loud again, what part should I install?",
                "answer": "Hello Tom, Thank you for the question. I suggest testing the Defrost Thermostat, PartSelect Number PS469522. The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. You can also test the Defrost Heater,  PartSelect Number PS2581596. If there is no continuity then the part is defective and will need to be replaced. Hope this helps!"

If your refrigerator and freezer sections are too warm, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.

The electronic control board listed for your model, part number 297370602, has been discontinued by Maytag and you will need to contact them to see if they have information on a replacement.

The condenser fan is not spinning, but turns freely when spun by hand. Not sure if I should replace the fan motor or the compressor start device ?",
                "answer": "Hi Melissa,\nThank you for your question.  If the compressor is warm, but not turning on, unplug the refrigerator from the electrical outlet and use a fan to cool it.  Once the compressor has cooled, plug the refrigerator back in.  If the compressor starts to work, but not the condenser fan motor, the motor will need to be replaced.  If the compressor does not come on check the start device and the run capacitor.

However, the water dispenser will also occasionally not dispense, it sounds like there is air in the line.  Any thoughts on what might cause this?  (i've replaced the filter several times and still having the issue)  thanks!",
                "answer": "Hi Andy,\nThank you for your question.  If you have air trapped in the water line, you will need to flush the water system to remove it.  Press and hold the water dispenser lever for a few minutes to completely flush the air out. If the water lines are not fitted correctly or if you have just recently replaced the water filter, air may become trapped in the water lines.  When you install a new water filter, it is important to flush the water filter before using it.  Consult your owner's manual for information on the correct procedure for your refrigerator.  If air is not the issue and the dispenser continues to occasionally not dispense water, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check dispenser door solenoid assembly, the water filter head, the electronic control board, the microswitch and the dispenser door assembly and flapper.  We hope this helps!  Good luck with the repair!"

Then there are three covers on your mullion at the bottom, middle, and top. You will have to pop those off using a flat head screw driver. Once you have done that you slide your mullion upward enough to install the new spring into place. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

Your should look at your start relay and your capacitor being the issue. You may also want to test your temperature sensors as well and make sure they are working correctly. I hope that helps.

        "description": "This water dispenser button is a genuine OEM part designed for LG refrigerators. When you push the button, a valve is activated inside the refrigerator, which releases water from the internal water supply. If the button is faulty, you will also likely notice that the dispenser can not release any water, or that it does so inconsistently. Over time the button may fail due to aging or due to accidental damage. You will need to replace the button if it is unresponsive when you push it, or if it seems stuck.",

                "answer": "Hi William, thank you for the question. Damaged or pinched water lines could be the reason for a slow water dispenser. You will need to inspect the water line outside your fridge to check it for damage. If you do not see any damage, make sure there are no “kinks” in the tube. If you want to check the water pressure on the refrigerator from the house. Just put the water supply hose in a 5-gallon bucket and let it run for 15 seconds to make sure you have good pressure and the saddle valve or whatever valve supplies water from the house to the refrigerator is not being restricted. If the water supply is good, disconnect the water line under the valve and put a towel underneath. Push the dispenser paddle and see if the pressure coming out of the valve is good. If all checks well, you are down to either the water filter or the filter housing. If this does not help, we recommend checking the water inlet valve, part number PS11712338. Glad to be of help!"

You will need to remove the ice bucket from the door.  Press the release valve to release the bucket from the door and remove any ice from the bin.  Turn the bucket upside down and you should see the ice bin button on the left hand side.  There should be 2 screws securing it in place.  Unscrew them and remove the old ice bin button.  Screw the new ice bin button in place and put the ice bucket back on the door.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

If the mullion is hot, the heat is generated by a heat loop located in the mullion and the walls near the gaskets to prevent moisture and frost from developing.  This will usually last 24 hours.  If it is warmer than normal, the issue may be with the condenser and you will need to clean it.  If the air flow around the condenser is blocked by dust, dirt and other debris, this will cause the both the mullion and walls near the gaskets to become warmer than normal.  It is important to clean it on a regular basis.  Also, if your refrigerator has an Energy Saver feature, this controls the heat and may cause the mullion to become warmer than normal.  You will need to check you owner's manual for information on how to use it.  We hope this helps!  Good luck with the repair!"

With this part, the house power is connected to the range wire harness. Some symptoms replacing the terminal block could be a solution for are little to no heat when baking, element will not heat and/or it will not start. This part will prevent loosening and will reduce damage caused by corrosion (by two different metals). Refer to the instructional diagram for further replacement guidance and exact placement. You must unplug the appliance before installing this part and wear gloves to protect your hands.",

I pulled the stove out and found the black wire at the terminal block had burned into it. Whoever installed the power cord did not tighten the nuts on the terminal block. Would this have caused the short or do you think something caused it and this was the weakest link so to speak? Also, do you think it damaged anything else? There is not any obvious damage or bare wires anywhere on the unit.",
                "answer": "Hello Preston,\n\nThanks for your question. This type of issue typically arises from loose wiring. I would recommend inspecting all of the range's wiring immediately to ensure nothing is damaged or still loose. Replace any wires that are damaged.\n\nI hope this helps."

                "answer": "Hello Pat, thank you for your question. If the start button isn't working properly, and you have to hold the start button we would recommend testing oven thermostat PartSelect Number PS11749737 first. This oven temperature sensor, for ranges, works together with the oven control board to measure and regulate the oven temperature.Testing the temperature sensor probe on your oven is easy. With the sensor at room temperature, measure the resistance between the two prongs at the end of the sensor connector. The resistance of the sensor should read approximately 1080 – 1090 ohms at room temperature. If that part measures within those readings, the electronic board should be replaced. I hope this helps!"

If the top elements as well as the oven are not working, I would recommend changing the terminal block and perhaps the power cord to the unit. Also check the plug  the appliance is plugged into to make sure the right voltage of power is coming to the unit. If the stove top burners are working but neither the baker OR the broil unit is working inside the oven section, the part you would need to replace is the Electronic Oven Control Board part number PS2357664. You may also want to check the Long Oven Sensor PS1570174. I hope this helps!"

Use a UL-listed power supply cord kit marked for use with clothes dryers. Choose a 4-wire power supply cord with ring or spade terminals and UL-listed strain relief. The 4-wire power supply cord, at least 4 ft long, must have four 10-gauge copper wires and match a 4-wire receptacle of NEMA Type 14-30R. The ground wire may be either green or bare. The neutral conductor must be identified by a white cover. We hope this helps!"

Food inside the refrigerator will absorb the cold air.  If the bins are set to the highest cold setting and they have no food or very little food inside them then the water tank will freeze.  You should only use the highest cold setting if the bins are full.  In general as well, if there is very little food in the refrigerator cold air will sink and stay at the bottom of the refrigerator and this will cause the water tank to freeze.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

Also i have a slight drip from the control unit in the back where to water lines connect. I don’t see this part, can you provide replacement? Thanks again, videos are just great!!",
                "answer": "Hello Joe, thank you for your question, and feedback about completing the tank repair! The water should be distributed within a few minutes. Allow for a bit of time for the water to get back through the system. The part the water lines connect to at the back of the fridge is called the water valve. If there is a little water leaking from there it should be replaced. That part number is PartSelect Number: PS304374 and we have an installation video on that part as well! Good luck!"

I disconnected the tubing from the water solenoid and water flows fine through the solenoid. As far as I can tell, the tank and tubing are the only things between the solenoid and the water dispenser.Is it possible that they are blocked?If so, should I just replace the whole tank assembly?  Thanks",
                "answer": "Hi Mike, Thank you for the question. In most cases if the dispenser is not dispensing it is the Micro Switch. The switch can be tested for continuity with a Multi Meter. It is also good to have the filter replaced ever 6 months. Only way to know if the water tubes are blocked is to remove them and run water through them. Hope this helps!"

If you notice the appliance is uneven to the floor or wobbling, it may indicate that the levelling foot needs to be replaced. You will need pliers and a block of wood to perform this task. There will be one adjustable foot found in the package. Lift the dryer and place the wood to keep it propped up. You may need to use the pliers to remove the old foot. Screw the new foot into place using your hand. Once the new leveling foot is in place, lift the appliance and remove the block. Test the machine out to ensure it is now sitting level.",

It acts as a barrier between the contents of the drawer and the external environment of the refrigerator. It protects the contents of the crisper drawer from debris, odors, and other contaminants that may be present. The front panel also helps to control the amount of airflow and humidity within the drawer, helping to keep fruits and vegetables fresh longer. It also contributes to the overall appearance of the refrigerator, providing a finished look to the crisper drawer. If the front panel is damaged, it may become difficult to slide the crisper drawer back and forth and the freshness of the food may be compromised.",

The front pan you mentioned is a crisper drawer front. If you are looking for the pantry drawer front, the front panel, part number PS11755821, is the part you need. We look forward to hearing from you if you need assistance with placing an order through our 7-days-a-week customer service. We hope this helps!"

It is a two-piece dish that is used to grill or cook food while the broil function is on, meaning it can withstand high temperatures. This set includes both the pan and the grid. The grid is the top part. The slotted design allows grease to easily drip into to the pan below. Not only does it catch all of the drippings, it also prevents splatter and smoke while cooking. The pan can also be used separately for baking and roasting. This cookware features a durable porcelain finish, which means it is incredibly easy to clean, and is dishwasher safe. It is roughly 1.5 inches deep, and measures approximately 16.5 inches by 12.5 inches. If your two-piece broil plan is lost, rusted, or damaged this is the replacement you need.",

If you require assistance to place an order, please contact customer service. We hope that helps!"

If your refrigerator is leaking in the area near the bottom air diffuser, you may have a blocked defrost drain and this is causing water too pool and during the freeze/defrost cycle, water will leak from the refrigerator.  You may also have a frozen water line.  You will need to inspect these parts to see see which one is the causing the issue.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

I assumed a failed condenser fan, but the schematic shows no fan in the freezer compartment.  What else could it be?",
                "answer": "Hi Ken,\nThank you for your question.  If the refrigerator is too warm, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the defrost timer, the cold control thermostat, the run capacitor, the evaporator fan motor and the fan blade. You will need to test the electronic parts with a multi-meter.  Here is a link to one of our videos on YouTube that you may use as a general reference on how to use one, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWC44fHn0As. For more information on how to test these parts, click on the Appliance Repair link on our website and on the next page that comes up click on the microwave icon. When the next page comes up, you will be provided with a symptoms list.  Choose the \"Fridge and Freezer too warm\" symptom and the information will come up for you.  We hope this helps.

                "answer": "Hi William, thank you for your question. When you are having temperature problems in your fridge, there are a few parts that could cause the issue. You can use a multi meter to test most of the parts. Make sure you cut power to your appliance before doing any repairs or tests. First you should test your defrost thermostat. Place the thermostat in ice cold water for 2-3 minutes after removing it from your appliance. It should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. Another part to check would be your defrost heater. Remove it from the appliance. It should be reading anywhere between 0 - 50 ohms to be working. You could check your temperature sensor. To find the correct reading for this part you will have to refer to your tech sheet that comes with your appliance. You can usually find this tech sheet behind the bottom grille of your fridge on either the right or left side. These are the most common parts that cause this issue in your appliance. So it is suggested you check them first. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

                "answer": "Hi James, Thank you for the question. To install this power cord you will need to turn off the water and unplug the appliance. You will then need to remove the front bottom kick plate panel to expose the water valve to remove the fill hose from the valve and the drain hose. You will then need to remove the screws at the top front that mount the dishwasher from the counter top. Then you can adjust the leveling legs to a lower position ans pull the appliance out to gain access to the back of the appliance. At the bottom corner you will see a box held closed by a screw. Open up the box and disconnect the wiring for the power cord. There is a washer with tabs around the hole for the power cord wiring. You can loosen it by pushing the tabs with a flat head screw driver and then unscrew it completely. Once the washer is removed you can pull the power cord out from the hole at the back of the box. Insert  the new cord through the hole and reattach the washer with tabs. Reattach the wiring and close up the box. Reverse the steps for the hoses and mounting the appliance. Hope this helps!"

Very sorry but we do not have the specs of the Cord, we just have the parts lists and diagram and can guarantee the PartSelect Number PS358548 is the correct cord for this model and will be the same cord that came with the appliance with the same Specs.

                "answer": "Hi Mitchell, thank you for your question. When you are having temperature problems in your fridge, there are a few parts that could cause the issue. You can use a multi meter to test most of the parts. Make sure you cut power to your appliance before doing any repairs or tests. First you should test your defrost thermostat. Place the thermostat in ice cold water for 2-3 minutes after removing it from your appliance. It should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. Another part to check would be your defrost heater. Remove it from the appliance. It should be reading anywhere between 0 - 50 ohms to be working. You could check your temperature sensor. To find the correct reading for this part you will have to refer to your tech sheet that comes with your appliance. You can usually find this tech sheet behind the bottom grille of your fridge on either the right or left side. These are the most common parts that cause this issue in your appliance. So it is suggested you check them first. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

                "answer": "Hello Cynthia, thank you for contacting us. Changing the ice blades depends on the conditions of the blades and has no defined period. Usually, it takes 6 months to two years to get the blade rusty. When you use rusty blades, it can actually make the ice unsafe for consumption. So, when you are starting to notice a difference in the consistency of your ice it’s definitely time to replace your blade. The best practice is to replace the blade once a year. We look forward to hearing from you if you need assistance with placing an order through our 7-days-a-week customer service. We hope this helps!"

This kit comes with all the necessary parts for a dishwasher rack adjuster.  It fits onto the dishwasher rack and connects it to the track allowing it to slide in and out. If broken then the rack will no longer slide properly, and the part must be replaced. In many cases, our customers have reported the top rack of their dishwasher hanging down or sagging due to the adjuster kit, particularly if the wheels, have broken or failed. If you are having problems in this area, this kit will help get your dishwasher back up and running. Check your model number and user manual to see if this part is right for you. The parts for this kit come as a package and are not generally sold individually.",

                "answer": "Hi David, \n\nThank you for your question. First you will have to remove your upper dish rack and the old adjust kit. Now, when installing the new kit, count 4 rungs from the back of the basket toward the front. Take your  new metal adjuster and thread the shaft through the fourth rung. You may have to tilt it to get it through. When you straighten the part the wheels portion should be on the outside of the rack and the shaft will  be on the inside of the rack. Take your positioner clips and use them to secure the adjuster to the rack. You will see two front tabs and two back tabs. The back tabs will also need to be tilted into place so that they are on the inside of the rack. The flat part of the positioner clips should be on the outside of the rack. Then you will push the clips down on to the adjuster to clip them into place. Now you will have to install the adjuster body on to the adjuster. Pull your adjuster all the way down. Tilt the adjusted toward the inside of the rack, you will notice that the adjuster body has a channel that will fit the adjuster. Slide those two pieces into place together. You will have 4 notches on your adjuster body that fit perfectly with your rack. Pull on your metal adjuster to lock it into place. Grab your actuator. You want to make sure that the thumb pad of your actuator is facing toward the inside of the rack and is closer to the front of the rack. Pull the adjuster arm up as far as you can, so that the body is a little bit above the top of the rack. The set the actuator inside of the two slots at the top of the body. You may have to tilt the body toward the inside of the rack to fit the actuator into place. Once you have that part in place, push the whole assembly down and press it back up against the side of the rack into place again. Now you will take the adjuster cover and install it on to the body from the outside of the rack. There is a little tab at the top of the cover, you will have to push that into place in the slot at the top of the adjuster body. That just snaps down into place. Then you install your two T15 Torx screws into the cover to hold it into place. This installation is the same for both sides. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

                "answer": "Hello Andrew, thank you for your question. The rack adjuster kit has been redesigned as the original adjuster was not as stable and was causing issues for customers. The adjuster kit would come with all parts for the right and left side of the upper rack and would be the only parts that would fix the issue you're having. I hope this helps!"

        "description": "The rack track stop on your dishwasher is designed to stop the dish rack at the appropriate place when opening and closing the rack. If your dishwasher is not cleaning your dishes properly, the rack stop may need to be replaced. The replacement part may differ slightly from the broken part, depending on the model. However, the different styles are interchangeable. This product is sold individually and comes in both a white and grey plastic version. Many of our customers found this repair to be very easy and takes less than 30 minutes to complete. Simply snap the old part out and snap the new part into place. You will not require any tools to complete the job. This is an authentic part approved by the manufacturer.",

The installation has been rated as \"easy\" by customers. Before beginning any repair, you should unplug the dishwasher and wear gloves to protect your hands.

Release the track stops from the upper dishrack rails and pull the upper rack from the dishwasher and place it upside down on a work surface.  Raise the wheels to the maximum height.  Release the top of the long rear clip from the dishrack tine and push the clip down to the release point and remove it.  Press the tab down on the front clip move the clip up to pull it off. Release the locking tabs  on the clip in the middle of the height adjuster and remove the clip. Using a slot screw driver pry the housing cover down and out to release the upper tabs on each side.  Pry the bottom of the housing cover out of the 2 lower locking tabs.  Pull the housing cover off the rack.  Remove the adjuster housing and wheel assembly and repeat the procedure on the other side.  Slide the vertical portion on the new wheel assembly between the fourth set of vertical tines from the back of the dishrack and rotate the wheel assembly so that it lays flat against the side.  Insert a positioner clip above the rear wheel and snap the tab into the slot.  Install a positioner clip on the front wheel.  Position the adjuster body over the vertical portion of the wheel assembly and push in into the slots. Locking tabs at the bottom of the adjuster body engage the the wheel assembly once it is fully inserted the tabs.  Insert the actuator lever into the adjuster body with the thumb pad facing the front of the rack.  Two half circle cut outs on the adjuster body hold the actuator in place.  Push the adjuster body down and install the adjuster cover.  Install the adjuster cover mounting screws.  Repeat this process on the other side of the rack.  Push the upper dishrack onto its tracks.  Close the track stops on the rails and the repair is done. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

Use a small flat head screwdriver to depress the retaining tabs securing the rack adjustors to the tracks. Fully remove the upper rack. Using the flat blade screwdriver, release the tabs to detach the adjuster housing cover and remove the housing. Next detach the front and rear adjuster support straps from the tines and remove them from the rack adjuster. Note the orientation of the rack adjuster, then pry off the stop clip to detach the old adjuster. Install the new adjuster by aligning it on the rack and snap the stop clip into place to secure. Next replace the front and rear support straps. Position the adjuster housing by aligning the locking lever in the adjuster slot then snap the cover on to secure. Then put the upper rack back into place.  Hope this helps!"

If it breaks or becomes damaged. sliding will feel difficult. This can happen due to normal wear and tear, and the part should be replaced if this occurs. Check your model number and user manual to make sure this part is correct. It attaches directly to the dishrack. To repair, open the dishwasher door and pull out the lower dishrack. Next, push the tab from both sides and it should pop out. To install the new wheel assembly, place it on the rack and make sure the caps overlap the wire from the inside before you clip it in place by pushing the wheel. It measures roughly 3x6 inches.",

If the lower dishrack stops moving in and out easily or preventing you from being able to shut the dishwasher door, inspect the dishrack roller for damage. The assembly includes 2 rollers and the bracket that attaches to the dishrack (parts are not sold separately). This assembly is sold individually, so you will need 4 assemblies to replace them all in your appliance. For this easy repair, start by removing the lower dishrack from the appliance and set it on the counter. Use a screwdriver to pry off the old roller assembly from the lower tabs. Align the new part on the dishrack by snapping it in place.",

        "description": "This dishwasher door gasket (Bottom Gasket, Gasket, Door Seal, Dishwasher Door Lower Seal) helps prevent water from leaking out of the bottom edge of your dishwasher door by creating a watertight seal. This part is attached to the bottom of your dishwasher inner door panel. It is frequently exposed to water and detergent during its lifetime. The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey. Includes one lower door gasket.",

Here’s the problem, after I change the gasket seal just barely touching it will slip it out. How do I stop this from happening, do I have the wrong part or was I supposed to get some sort of glue or clip thing? The notch is on the right side that was indicated in the video too. Can you help me?",
                "answer": "Hi Helena, based on your situation we recommend pressing the gasket with controlled pressure into the channel that is on the inner door liner. It should be a snug fit, and if it is too loose it needs to be pushed in further. I hope this helps."

The manufacturers part number I found under your model number is different from the one you have referenced in your question to us.  The part number I have found is 5304500204 (our part number for it is PS11703834). Frigidaire may have provided you with the wrong part.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

Then check that the door aligns with the tub opening, and that the splash guard does not have any damage. If everything is in good condition, check the float for sticking, and the spray arm for splitting. One of these should solve your problem. However, if you are still having leakage, please let us know and we will help you solve it."

If it's damaged or broken, you'll start seeing water leaking out. If broken, it should be replaced. Refer to your model number and user manual to ensure this part is right for you. When making this repair, open the dishwasher door and take out the lower dish tray for better access. Pull out the old gasket, and clean the channel with a rag. Push the new gasket into place into the notch on the door, which you should see upon close inspection, using a flat-head screwdriver for assistance if necessary. We do not recommend cutting any additional length off on the tub gasket if any is present during your repair.",

When I push the top of the door in the heat that escapes is reduced and just comes out of the vent on the left top of the door which is what it is supposed to do. Since there is no actual water escaping from the door seal would replacing the door seal solve this problem?",

You can also check the door strike, the part the latch would connect with. Make sure it isn't lose or is damaged and preventing the latch from fully keeping the door closed.You can also check to make sure the hinges are not warped or bent. The door should be sitting level when it is closed. Hope this helps!"

It is still dripping on the left side, front, in the corner. Can't figure out where it's coming from. Anyone have any suggestions?  Should i replace the tub gasket as well?  Anything else? Thanks for responding.",

I called GE to see if there is a gasket for the bottom of the door, and there is, i am not sure how to remove or install the gasket.  There are no visible screws so i think i have to lift the door and unhinge then pull out.. maybe then i can see where the gasket is..then remove old one and replace with new one.  please advise",
                "answer": "Hi Donna,\nThank you for your question.  For this model there should be screws that you will need to remove. Remove the screws at the bottom of the door, then slide it back along the hinges until you can access the bottom gasket. Remove the gasket, then set the new one in place and reposition the door accordingly, then reapply the screws. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

                "answer": "Hi Jill,\nThank you for your question.  If the gap is at the bottom of the door, you will need to install a gasket if it is not already there.  The part number listed under your model number for the gasket is PS11700870.  The gasket creates a seal at the bottom of the dishwasher tub, so water does not leak out while the dishwasher is running. If you notice water leaking out onto the floor, you should inspect the gasket for damages and replace as necessary. The gasket is gray in color and is approximately 22 inches long. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

Generally you can just remove a few of them from the bottom half to get enough wiggle room to replace the gasket, however you can also remove all of the screws to remove the entire inner panel. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.",

Based on our research, here are the steps to replace the part: 1) Ensure your unit is unplugged or the circuit breakers are off before beginning any repair. 2) Turn off the dishwashers water supply underneath the sink. 3) Open up the dishwasher door. 4) Pull the lower rack out and set it aside. 5) Reach in to remove the lower wash arm (On each side on the bottom of the Spray Arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screw driver to release it from the unit). 6) Once locking tabs have been released, you can pull it off the dishwasher. 7) Put the new lower wash arm in (simply set it down onto its support and push it down to lock it in place). 8) Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. 9) Put the lower dish rack back in. 10) Close the dishwasher door and you are done. We hope this helps! Best Regards."

        "description": "This lower spray arm assembly is a device in your dishwasher that distributes water and detergent during the washing cycle. Its rotating motion sprays water in multiple directions, ensuring thorough cleaning. Typically, it is attached to a support or hub at the bottom of the dishwasher. When this part is broken, there are noticeable signs to be aware of. You might hear knocking or banging sounds coming from the dishwasher. The spray arm may be wobbly or unable to rotate. If a broken arm assembly is not replaced, your dishes may still have dirt on them even after a wash cycle. Additionally, leftover food residue can result in an unpleasant smell within the dishwasher. To remove the existing arm assembly, simply grasp the center of it and lift it up so that it unsnaps from your dishwasher. Please note that this OEM-sourced part is sold individually.",

The function of these parts is to spray water to all levels of the dishwasher so the dishes will come out completely clean. This kit has recently been redesigned. It does not include the upper support or mount, so consider ordering those parts as well if necessary. The spray arm is approximately 18 inches long, and all parts are white in colour. The only tool you will need to complete this repair is a Phillips screw driver.",

I am not showing a video listed with the grommet on our website, but a customer has left a comment as to how they have installed the part.  \"Removed lower trim covers (2 Phillips screws) disconnected power supply at breaker box. Removed wire from heating element, removed (broken) brass nut, unclipped heating element and removed. Removed flat washers and replaced with new grommets. Kind of tricky getting them in there. Also had to lube them with silicone to get the element back through. Installed new brass nuts and installed wire connectors. Reset breaker and started dishwasher to verify repair. No leaks, working just fine, reinstalled lower trim covers\"  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

        "description": "This manufacturer-certified heating element is used to create heat during the dry cycle and increase water temperature during portions of the wash cycle when certain options are selected. If your dishes are not drying or the water in the dishwasher is not getting hot you may need to replace the element. This kit includes the heater, two heater fasteners, and is a genuine OEM part. Please remember to disconnect the power before starting the repair. Use a multi-meter to test your heating element for continuity to determine whether this is the part that is causing your symptom. This part does not include any washers. To make your repair, disconnect the wires from the bottom of the element in the back, remove the plastic nuts holding it in place, remove the element, and repeat these steps in reverse order to install your new part. This is an easy repair that requires only a screwdriver, wrench set, and should take less than 30 minutes.",

                "question": "How do you check the heating element for continuity?",
                "answer": "Hello Jeff, thank you for your question. To test the element, locate your dishwasher's heating element. Open the dishwasher door and look into the tub. It is the thin, circular tube at the base of your dishwasher. It may or may not be covered. If it is covered, remove the lower dishrack, and then remove the cover.\n\nYour heating element is going to have two metal terminals. One at each end. Each terminal reaches downwards, into the base of the dishwasher. Mentally mark the area where each terminal enters the base of the tub.\n\nNow you need to gain access to the heating element's wiring. You can do this by first removing the lower kickplate panel of the dishwasher. There will be at least two screws (but maybe four) holding the kickplate panel in place. They are located either on the top or the bottom of the panel. If the screws are located on the top, you may need to open the dishwasher door in order to gain access to them. Close the door to remove the panel, though.\n\nNow look into the lower access area that you have just uncovered. Pinpoint the area where the heating element terminals extend through the base of the dishwasher. They will each have a wire connected to it. Label each of the wires so that you will be able to properly reconnect them later. Now you can pull the wires off the terminals.\n\nEach wire is connected to a terminal using a slip-on connector. Grasp the connector and pull on it firmly. DO NOT pull on the wire itself. Pull only from the connector. You may decide you need to use a pair of needle nosed pliers to help you.\n\nUse your multitester (aka multimeter) to test the heating element for continuity. Set the device to the ohms setting x 1. Touch each meter probe to a terminal. You should receive a reading somewhere in between infinity and zero. Because of the variety of makes and models of dishwashers, it is quite difficult to say exactly what the reading should be for each and every possible model. However, if the test you conduct produces a reading of infinite resistance (meter's needle does not move), then that is indicative of a faulty heating element, and you should replace yours. Similarily, if the test you conduct produces a reading of zero resistance (meter's needle moves to the other extreme of the scale), then that is also indicative of a faulty heating element, and you should replace yours.\n\nYou do not have to remove the heating element from the dishwasher in order to test it. Just make sure power is not getting to your dishwasher before you conduct the test. I hope this helps!"

The dishes are now getting clean, but it is not drying them completely, there is water on especially the silverware(the tray is in the door).I'd appreciate any help you can give as we already spent $102 hoping these items would fix it as its out of warranty.  not sure how much money we should spend on it, its only been used for 2 years.",
                "answer": "Hello Roberta. Thanks for your question. I do know that rinse aid is very important to your appliance being able to dry your dishes properly. If you are using rinse aid then the problem might lie in your control board. The electronic control board is PartSelect Number: PS11737960- this is rarely the issue, but it could be worth cutting off power to the dishwasher for one minute and then restarting it to see if that fixes the issue before replacing the board. I hope this helps."

                "answer": "Hello Sri, Thank you for your inquiry. To pull the dishwasher out from under the countertop. Shut off the electricity at the breaker. Tip: place a piece of tape over the breaker switch to ensure no one turns it on while you're working. Turn off the water under the sink. Take off the front cover at the bottom of the dishwasher to expose the wiring. Use a voltage meter to test the wires at the dishwasher to ensure the power is still off. Remove the electrical box from the unit. Unscrew the wire nuts and pull apart the wires. Start with the green wires, white and then black. Disconnect the drain line from the dishwasher and the water supply line from the dedicated dishwasher stop. Open the door to the dishwasher, then remove the screws secured to the underside of the countertop. Raise the legs using a wrench. Slowly pull out the dishwasher ensuring the wires are out of the way. Also, the drain line should come out with the dishwasher from under the sink. Tip: Place a drop cloth or piece of cardboard in front of the dishwasher to prevent scratches on the floor. Also, before turning electricity back on, make sure to tape or cap off the ends of the three exposed wires. Although we do not have a repair video for this exact model for the heating element, I have included a video link for a similar Whirlpool heating element. Hope this helps!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Co8dQ7rzTMQ&index=25&list=PLD984081941E1E8CD"

                "answer": "Hello Joe. Thanks for your question. The issue could be the electronic control board is PS11731265 - this is rarely the issue, but it could be worth cutting off power to the dishwasher for one minute and then restarting it to see if that fixes the issue before replacing the board. The heating element should read between 8 and 30 ohms. If the element is testing good, I would suggest checking the thermostat, part number PS11750035. I hope this helps!"

Pour vinegar directly over the heating element and wait for 5 minutes for it to start its acidic action and then scrub it with a brush. Start a cycle of your dishwasher at the hottest settings. Finally, to get the odor out of your dishwasher, use a solution of dish soap and water to clean the inside of your dishwasher and rinse with warm water. We hope that helps!"

                "answer": "Hi Stephen,\nThank you for your question.  For this repair you will need to use a Phillips head screwdriver and a ½ inch wrench.  Before beginning any repair, please turn the water off and either unplug the appliance or turn the circuit breaker off.   To begin the repair, open the door and remove the lower dishrack.   Then remove the lower spray arm by pulling it straight up.   Use the screwdriver to unthread the screws securing the dishwasher to the counter and then pull the dishwasher out half-way.   Then remove the wires from the heater terminals.  Take note of how they are positioned before removing them.  Then, with the half inch wrench, unscrew the mounting nuts securing the terminals.  Then pull out the old heater terminals and release the heater terminals from the retaining clips.  Install the new heater element terminals into the openings.  There should be 2 white dots on the heating element.  Where the white dots are positioned is where they slide into to the retaining clips.  Once the element has been placed into the clips, push the terminals down and reinstall and tighten the mounting nuts with the wrench.  Place the wires back onto the terminals and slide the dishwasher back into the counter.  Secure the dishwasher to the counter with the 2 screws.  Reinstall the lower spray arm and push it down to lock it in.  Place the lower rack back into the dishwasher and restore power and water to the dishwasher.  If you have any questions, please let us know.  We are open 7 days a week.  We look forward to hearing from you!"

        "description": "This part replaces your appliances latch (Door Latch Kit, Door Catch, Dryer Door Latch Kit). On your appliance you will find both a strike and a catch. The strike is mounted on the body of the dryer, while the catch is mounted on the dryer door. These two parts work together to keep your dryer door closed. The catch holds the door strike to keep the door closed during the drying cycle. If the door does not latch closed, you won’t be able to start a drying cycle. If this part is malfunctioning, you may not be able to open or close your door. In some instances, it may seem like your door is closing, but if it is not latching properly you won’t be able to start your drying cycle. You should replace this part as soon as it’s malfunctioning. Your dryer may run even though the latch is malfunctioning, but it is unsafe if the dryer continues to run while the door is open. This replacement part features 1 door latch kit which includes 2 strikes, 3 catches, and a set of instructions. This model is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in white/silver.",

                "answer": "Hi Joanne, it sounds like you need to replace the door switch, it is part number WP3406105. Best of luck with this repair!"

                "answer": "Hello Eric,\n\nThanks for your question. Number 020 is the yellow catch. Number 022 is the blue catch. Number 025 is the green catch. If the catch you are replacing has an 18 on it or if it is silver, use the 020 yellow catch. If nothing matches check if your dryer has one catch, and make sure it is not a 27\" Wide Laundry Center or a Commercial Stacked Pair and if that is true, use the 020 yellow catch. If it is either of those types of machines, use the 025 green catch. If your dryer has two catches, use the 022 blue catch on the top and the 020 yellow catch on the bottom.\n\nI hope this helps."

                "question": "My dryer will not start when i push the start button.  I have already replaced the door switch, but that did not fix the problem.  Here is what's happening;  when i have the dryer set to start and close the door, the dryer makes a soft whirring/clicking sound.  When i push the start button, there is a loud click, the whirring stops, but the dryer does not start.  Do these symptoms give any indication of which part might be faulty?",
                "answer": "Hi Erin,\n\nThank you for your question. There are a couple of other parts that you would check to see if they are working correctly. The first part I would actually suggest testing is your start switch. You may also want to test your thermal fuse as well. You can test both parts with a multi meter to see what the continuity is on them. If both of those parts are fine you might go on to test your thermostats and your element as well. If those parts are fine then it may be your timer that is the issue. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

Do you have any idea where that may have come from? I think someone may have put too much weight on the door and forced it past the normal stop position. I will order the latch anyway but I am wondering if anything else could be wrong? In addition, the light burned out. Does it require the exact replacement bulb?",
                "answer": "Hello Gerald,\n\nThanks for your question. The door catch kit would be the most likely solution for your problem based on your description. As for the bulb, we are only showing one bulb that is compatible with your machine based on the manufacturer's part list.\n\nI hope this helps."

                "answer": "Hi Laura, Thank you for the question. The catch can be swapped to the other side yes but it sounds like there could be an issue with the door switch,PartSelect Number PS3653055. If the switching the catch did not fix the issue I recommend replacing the switch. Hope this helps!"

                "answer": "Hi Morgan, thank you for your question. These would be the instructions from the manufacturer: This kit contains (2) door strikes and various door catches. Some dryers may use more than (1) catch. Note numbers stamped on the catches and/or color of the spring steel, 20 (yellow), 22 (blue) or 25 (green). Match the number and/or color, of the catch being replaced with the catch supplied in the kit. If the catch you’re replacing has an 18 stamped on it or is silver in color, use the catch stamped with 20 (yellow) for replacement. The (2) door strikes contained in the kit are the same. Please replace the door strike(s) with the appropriate number of door catches being used for this repair. If you cannot match the number on the catches, match the catch(es) by the following: 1. If your dryer has one catch and is not a 27” Wide Laundry Center or Commercial Stacked Pair, use the catch stamped with 20 (yellow) for replacement. If it is a 27” Laundry Center or Commercial Stacked Pair, use the catch stamped with 25 (green) for replacement. 2. If your dryer has 2 catches, use the catch stamped with 22 (blue) on the top and the catch stamped 20 (yellow) on the bottom.  I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

You will need to check the thermal fuse, the door catch and strike, the internal bias thermostat, the drive belt,  the idler pulley and the drive motor.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

                "answer": "Hello Pius, if you are experiencing problems with your buzzer shutting off, that would be a motor switch issue. It sounds like the motor switch is sticking/stuck and the only way to correct that would be to replace the motor. You can find the motor for your model here 279827. I hope this helps!"

        "description": "This door latch (Dishwasher Door Latch Assembly, Door Latch Assembly, Latch Assembly) is a simple on/off mechanism that prohibits the dishwasher from operating when the door is open. It is located on the door of your dishwasher, and is mounted on the inner door panel. The door latch can break from material fatigue. If the door is often slammed or opened quickly, the latch may break prematurely. If the door won't open or the door switches won't activate, you will need to replace this part. This latch measures 5 1/2 inches wide, 4 1/2 inches high, 2 1/2 inches deep, is constructed out of plastic and comes in black. The kit includes the black handle, latch, and 2 switches.",

                "answer": "Hello Jamie. This is the correct assembly WPW10130695 for your white dishwasher, and it includes everything you need to replace the handle. To begin this repair, unplug your dishwasher or disconnect the power. You will want to remove the screws that are holding the inner door to remove the inner door panel. You will see wires leading to the old latch assembly, remove them and the assembly. Using the same steps but backwards you can connect the new assembly, put it back in place, and reattach the inner door panel. Good luck with this repair!"

                "answer": "Hi David, great question. You are right, the only way to open a jammed door would be to lift the door and with controlled movements to jerk it outwards. Before attempting this, we recommend checking the dishwasher to make sure it is properly mounted so that the jerking movement does not slide it out of place and hurt the dishwasher. Otherwise, by doing this you will not be at risk for breaking anything. Just be careful and give yourself some space. I hope this helps."

This drain pump assembly is made of plastic and fits within the sump assembly, which controls the flow of water into the drain. This drain pump assembly is a genuine OEM part and is made of a high-quality plastic but is sold as an individual component without any other parts, like its drain pump check ball which works within the pump to prevent water from backwashing into the pump, as well as the drain pump cover. If you notice your dishwasher is not draining or has a lot of water buildup at the bottom of the sump assembly, this filter may be damaged, clogged or broken, and in need of a replacement. To replace this pump assembly, you will only need a Philips-head screwdriver, but should start by removing your dishwasher racks. Then, pull up on the lower spray arm, and drain trap to remove them. Next, rotate the spray arm support and pull that up to remove it, at which point you can remove the base and filter for the drain pump. With those out, you can use your Philips-head screwdriver to disconnect and remove the cover and drain pump assembly. With the pump removed, you can inspect it or install the new drain pump assembly, with the same hardware as before. Then it is as simple as reassembling the rest of your dishwasher, ensuring each connection point is fastened tightly.",

It took a while but eventually it made it through to the dishwasher basin. But it still didnt drain.\n\nI then removed the drainpipe and re-attached. I never found anything that would clog it. But when I reassembled it, it worked. But again yesterday it stopped draining again. But I would try to re-attach some of the wires and it would eventually work. But sometimes would stop in the middle of running, with lights flashing or it all would go dark. Again, I'd \"play\" with the wire connections underneath a bit and it would eventually run through. I have no idea if any of my write-adjusting is having an effect or not.\n\nBased on my search here, it may need a drain pump assembly replaced, but is there any other troubleshooting I can do before I go that route to be sure that is the issue?\n\nThank you for your time - I appreciate the assistance.",
                "answer": "Hello Aaron, thank you for contacting us. Before replacing the drain pump, we would recommend checking the wire connections of the pump and making sure no connection is loose or damaged. Also, check the drain pump filter, part number PS11770489, and ensure that it is not damaged or clogged. If this does not help, replacing the drain pump, part number PS8689824, is the most likely solution. Customer service is always available to help you place an order if you are having trouble doing so. Good luck with your repair."

If the impeller in the dishwasher is damaged or the motor has been shorted out and will not drain, it is possible the body is cracked, causing leakage. To prevent this from happening, replace the drain pump. The tools needed for this installation are: Phillips screwdriver, 5/16 inch nut driver, 5/8 inch wrench, and a flathead screwdriver. Remember to unplug your dishwasher from the power source before beginning this installation project. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further installation instructions.",

I would suggest checking your door latch switches just to make sure they are working. If they are not the machine may think the door is open and will not go into the automatic drain cycle. However, if that part is working then it may be your control board that is the issue. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

The If there is water left over at the end of the cycle, I would suggest checking the water inlet valve to be sure its not leaking into the unit, the float switch and the drain pump itself.

If the motor does not run during the drain cycle, or if it simply hums instead of running, it may need to be replaced. Also check the drain hoses to see if they are clogged. Lastly, look at the sump pump check valve. If it is stuck closed it will keep the water from draining. Clean that out and replace it if it is necessary.\n\nI hope this helps."

I first ordered from you and replaced the drain pump but problem was still there. Then the clean led blinking 7 times was pointing to a heating problem so i replaced the bi-metal fuse and heating elements. But problem is still there. I could notice during washing cycle that it would stop for a long time doing nothing. Anything else i could check? I am out of ideas and about to replace the whole thing after spending time and money on parts.",
                "answer": "Hello Sylvain, Thank you for the question. I suggest checking the Turbidity Sensor, PartSelect Number PS11757214. If you disconnect power from the dishwasher, you can test the turbidity sensor at connection P12 of the control board. From pin 1 to pin 3, you should get a resistance reading between 46 to 52 K Ohms. If the resistance is not within this range, then you will need to replace the sensor. Hope this helps!"

I would say try those things first, maybe go through a couple of cleaning cycles with a dishwasher cleaner. Finish is usually a very good brand. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

The blockage paralyzes the work of this part, making draining impossible or at least difficult. The impeller of the pump is damaged or worn out.

The soil trap handle is then turned toward you so the handle is facing you. Lift the soil trap out of the unit. The spray arm holder is still attahed so it will have to be removed and reinstalled into the new soil trap. Reverse the steps to reinstall the parts into the dishwasher. I hope this helps!"

                "answer": "Hi Rosalind,\nThank you for your question.  If you have your dishwasher hooked up to a garbage disposal, you will need to check the drain line.  Turn your disposal on to make sure it is clean and that it is draining correctly.  If it is draining correctly, remove the drain hose and inspect it for any clogs.  If there are no clogs, then the issue lies elsewhere.  If your dishwasher is not hooked up to a garbage disposal, you will need to check the air gap if your sink has one.  The air gap is located near your faucet.  If there is water leaking from it, then this is a sign that it is clogged.  Remove the cap and use a tube to blow air down into it to remove any debris that is trapped there.  If this is not the issue, then you will need to check the dishwasher drain.  If the drain is clogged this would be the reason why you still have water in your dishwasher.  You will need to clean it to resolve the issue.  We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know."

        "description": "This filter works with the water pump in your dishwasher. It prevents debris from entering the pump and causing damage. As a result, the filter can occasionally become clogged or damaged, and will need to be replaced. A good indication of a damaged filter is if your dishwasher is not draining or cleaning the dishes properly. This filter has a gray plastic top and bottom that are approximately 5 inches in diameter. This is a genuine OEM part that comes directly from the manufacturer. To replace the filter, simply turn it counterclockwise to unlock, and then screw in the new filter",

Reach in and pull out the lower rack until it is resting on the door, and then remove it and set it aside. Push down on the filter and twist it counterclockwise. Turn the filter until it stops moving, with the tabs released. Pull the filter out of the dishwasher.\n\nPut the new filter in by setting it into the opening, possibly turn it a bit. Then turn it clockwise to lock it in. Put the lower rack back in by setting it on the door and sliding it in. Close the door, plug in the dishwasher again.\n\nI hope this helps."

We would recommend checking the following parts to fix your issue: drain hoses, drain pump, filter, the sump and also make sure that there are no clogs where the water drains into the sink/disposal. Check for any obstructions around the pump and sump system, and also clean the filter. Hope this helps!"

It would be a good idea to run a mixture of water and vinegar or a dishwasher cleaning solution. That should help take care of the smell. If it does not, you may have to disassemble the unit some, and clean the discharge tubes, and sump. I hope this helps!"

Ran dishwasher and noted that although the bottom surface of the dishwasher no longer had water remaining, there was about 1 2\" of water remaining in the well into which the filter is inserted. Is that normal?",
                "answer": "Hello Gary, Thank you for your inquiry. Anywhere around 1 cup of water leftover after a cycle is normal. It's there to keep the seals from drying up and your dishwasher will pump it out immediately before you get started on a new load. However, if it does not, you may want to check your drain pump and drain hoses. Hope this helps."

Not always mind you, as sometimes we have had a complete cycle go through with no problems. I'm stumped. Any advice? Control board maybe?  Thanks for your assistance.",
                "answer": "Hello Steve, thank you for inquiring. This is caused by a block or clog in the drain path. This could be the Sump, Pump, or Drain Hose.

I would test the circulation pump and motor assembly as this is what forces the water up through the spray arm to clean the dishes, if any one part of it is not working, the lower spray arm won't turn.

        "description": "If your dishwasher is leaking or not draining properly, you may need to replace the drain hose. The drain hose connects to the pump located below the lower spray arm and aids in proper dishwasher drainage. This white and black plastic hose is 7.5 feet long. For this repair, you will need either a 1/4-inch or 5/16-inch nut driver, depending on your model. You will need to remove the lower access panel on your dishwasher to complete this repair; it is often easier to remove the dishwasher from the cabinet to do so. Be sure to disconnect the dishwasher from both the power and water supply before completing this repair.",

The mid/Upper Arm is part PS12753867. The Conduit the arm connects to is part PS6883615. However, the arm is basically powered by the water pressure from the Water Inlet  Valve part PS16217027.So, if it is malfunctioning that could affect how fast or how much pressure is applied to the dishes.

I have researched the model you have provided and have found the part you are looking for is PartSelect Number PS972325 for the Door Balance Link Kit. This part is a door balance link kit, also sometimes known as door cable or door spring cable kit, that helps support the door as it opens and closes by connecting to the dishwasher door hinges. The kit includes two door balance links and two door balance mounts with wheels, which will replace both the left and right sides. The only tool needed is a 5/16 nut driver. Before removing the existing kit, take note of how the door balance link kit is assembled for a smooth replacement process. It is recommended to check the door springs in case they need to be replaced as well. Hope this helps!"

To fix it you must lift the door, and see if you can pop it back on to the hinge pin. If you are not able to, you may need to pull the unit outwards to access the hinge assembly. If you cannot get the door back onto the hinge pin, you may need to replace the hinge assembly because it may be damaged. I hope this helps."

                "answer": "Hi Bonnie,\nThank you for your question.  If the door is not latching correctly, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the door balance link kit, the mounting brackets, the door springs, the adjuster clips, the door hinges, the door strike and the door latch.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

                "answer": "Hi Thomas, Thank you for the question. If the rack is coming off the end of the rails when you pull it out you will need to check the rack stops. The stops fit in the end of the rails that attach to the inside wall of the dishwasher and prevent the rack from coming all the way out and off the rails. Hope this helps!"

The door hinge cable and the door spring apply tension to the door to prevent it from dropping open too quickly. This part contains two plastic pieces which are approximately 2 inches in length by 3/4-inch in width, as well as a rope portion that measures approximately 8 inches in length. When beginning this repair, be sure to use caution when replacing the door hinge cable. The spring to which the door hinge cable attaches is under tension and could snap.

Other customers have said it was a easy repair. here is a post from another customer. \"This procedure assumes that the DW water connection and drain are flexible. Remove Phillips head screws (2) mounting top front of DW to underside of counter. Grasp door and gently coax DW outwards approximately 1 foot. WEAR SAFETY GOGGLES. On RHS check lower end of door spring and note in which notch the spring sits. On RHS, grasp white plastic connector (\"hinge bushing\", with spring looped around one end), stretch the spring while carefully lifting other end of connector up, out of slot in door hinge lever. Pry door hinge lever 1/8\" away from DW body while sliding friction sleeve over its end. Work friction sleeve past hinge hook, past wider section, into narrower slot (about 2\" from end of hinge hook). Raise door to closed position. Insert and hold lower (90 degree) end of spring into the same notch that it was originally in (mine was in the 5th from the front). Loop the door end of the spring into one end of the white plastic hinge bushing, then insert the other end of the bushing into the door hinge lever's hook while stretching the spring. It does not require much strength. CAUTION: If the lower end of the spring is not properly inserted and held in the notch, it can pop out and possibly injure you! Repeat for the LHS. Push the DW back in place, and reinstall the two mounting screws. \" Hope this helps!"

                "answer": "Hi Mike,\nThank you for your question.  If you are opening the door all the way and it is closing part way on its own, then the door spring tension may not be adjusted correctly.  To adjust the door spring tension first unhook the spring from the rear leg of the dishwasher.  Then with a 5/16\" nut driver or hex socket, remove the screw from the tensioner.  The screw can be put into one of three holes in the front leg of the dishwasher. If the door closes by itself, move the tensioner to a higher number hole and replace screw. I hope this helps.

However, looking at other questions here, The fact that the door falls open (e.g. no tension at all), do I maybe need to replace the springs as well?  If so, is there one on each side?",

If your door is not opening and closing properly, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the door hinges, the door springs, the friction sleeve and the hinge bushings.  Once you have determined the part you need, please feel free to call customer service.

        "description": "This rack adjuster kit (Dishrack Adjuster Kit, Adjuster Kit, Dishwasher Rack Adjuster) will adjust the height of the upper rack of your dishwasher. It connects to the dishrack.  The kit is constructed of grey plastic and metal, and measures approximately 12 inches wide and 6.5 inches tall. The rack adjuster can break from material fatigue or prolonged high temperature exposure. High temperature exposure can compromise the integrity of the materials. If the rack adjuster breaks, your upper rack may fall down, may be unlevel, or the door may not close. This kit includes the parts to replace the left and right-side rack adjusters and has been upgraded to a more durable metal design (2 adjuster assemblies, 1 left hand and 1 right hand actuator cover, 2 gray adjuster covers, and 2 gray adjuster housings)",

        "description": "This water inlet valve is usually located behind the lower kickplate panel in either the right or left corner of the dishwasher. The attaching solenoids on the valve open and close according to the desired amount of water needed. The water inlet valve on your dishwasher supplies water to the dishwasher. If your dishwasher is leaking because it has overflowed, the water inlet valve may be the cause. If your dishwasher continues to fill above the heating element, try opening the door latch to see if it stops filling. If it continues to fill, you have a defective inlet valve that will need to be replaced.",

                "answer": "Hi Dean,\n\nThank you for your question. You would be able to test your water inlet valve with a multi meter to see if it is malfunctioning or not. When testing your valve, if your meter does not change at all that means that your part has no continuity and will need to be replaced. Good luck with your repair."

                "answer": "Hello Lyman, thank you for your question. The first part you will want to check in this kind of situation is the water fill valve. It sounds like the water valve is stuck in an open position. Checking a water valve is very easy. Use your multitester to test the valve for continuity. Set the device to the ohms setting x 1. Touch each of the meter's probes to a terminal. If you receive a reading of infinity, it means the valve's solenoid is faulty and the valve needs to be replaced. If your valve has two solenoids (four terminals), test the second pair of terminals in the same manner. If either pair of terminals receives a result of infinity, replace the water inlet valve. You do not have to remove the water inlet valve from the dishwasher in order to test it. Just make sure power is not getting to your dishwasher before you conduct the test. If the valve is not faulty, the issue is most likely the control board, as that board is what runs the cycles on the unit and acts like a timer, it could be stuck in a fill setting The water valve for your appliance is part number 154637401 and the board is part number 154886103. I hope this helps!"

To clean the spray arm, remove it from the dishwasher and place it in a solution of dishsoap, 1 cup of vinegar and warm water and let it soak until the debris has loosened.  If there are mineral deposits from hard water, soak it in vinegar. Use an old toothbrush, or other scrubbers to clean the surfaces of the arm. Also, use toothpicks or some other tool that you can use to remove any build up from the holes.  Once the arm has been thoroughly cleaned, reattach it inside the dishwasher.  We hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day."

If its filling up fine, but it isn't cleaning or washing properly, its likely the filter under part PS11759673 that would need to be replaced instead. We hope this helps!"

I could hear it washing and it did drain, but dishwasher will not fill with water on its own.",

I shut off water and waited.  After 10 minutes i turned water back on and it had stopped.  I don't know what else it could be.  I think if it were the float, the water would have stopped running when i opened the door (and when the power was turned off).  Thoughts?",

Yes, if the water continued to run into the unit even after the door was opened and power was off, the water valve is stuck in an open position.

What does the inlet valve do and could that be bad.",

Something may be jammed, like the chopper assembly, your pump and motor mechanism, or your drain pump. You would have to pull out your dishwasher for this and take it apart a bit. I hope that helps.

As mentioned in the video, the original screws are 5/16, but they won't screw into the new bracket (whether trying to attach it to the dishwasher or just trying screw right to bracket as a test).  Did the threading on these change at some point so my original screws won't fit this new replacement part? (it didn't come with screws).  Thanks.",

But, if the water is present in large quantity may be the water inlet valve, part number PS3654179, is malfunctioning.

I suggest checking the following parts: PS1524996 Door Spring, PS1524995 Friction Door Cable, counter balance arms PS12365372 PS12365372, and just checking the screws that mount the top of the dishwasher into the counter.

                "answer": "Hi Julie, thank you for your question. You should take a look at your spring to make sure it does not need replacing but the part to really check would be your friction cable. That part along with the spring helps your door not to fall quickly to the floor. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

If your dishwasher door drops when you open it, you may need to purchase the friction door cable, part number PS1524995, the door spring, part number PS1524996, or the door hinge kit, part number PS12365372.  If you would like to place an order for these parts, you may order them either online or by calling our customer service line and anyone will be happy to assist you.  We hope this helps!

It is an upside down \"u\" shape in three straight pieces, and i cant figure out how to remove it without damaging it.  I am trying to replace the door springs as the door is currently falling all the way open.  Is there a way to remove it and put it back without damaging it, or should i try to slide the unit out with the gasket in place? If there is a way to send a picture i can do that. Thank you, bill",

To remove the gasket, you actually have to remove your mounting brackets at the top of your dishwasher and then pull the machine out a little bit. You would then slide the left and right sides up from your dishwasher and then pull your gasket off. I hope that helps! Good luck with your repair."

Parts must be in resaleable condition to qualify: - “Resaleable” means that the part must not have incurred damage, such as signs of installation by the customer, marks, or scuffing. - Part must also be in its original packaging to be considered resaleable. Please inspect part before removing from its packaging, as this can cause return to be rejected. - Electrical parts are subject to additional scrutiny. - Rejected returns cannot be shipped back to customers.

                "answer": "Hi Linda,\nThank you for your inquiry.  The detergent dispenser is designed to release detergent into the dishwasher tub during the wash cycles and will typically have two compartments, an unsealed compartment for prewash and a sealed compartment for the main wash cycle. Verify that the dispenser is not simply clogged with caked on detergent and give it a good cleaning if necessary. Also check to make sure that the cover for the dispenser will open easily and is not damaged or broken. Check the release mechanism for worn or defective parts and replace if necessary. The rinse aid dispenser is designed to release rinse aid into the tub during the rinse cycle. Verify that the dispenser is full and is not clogged with detergent and verify that the cap is adjusted properly. The dispensers may be operated by either a mechanical devise or by a bi-metal release or wax motor devise.  The rinse aid cap could be the reason why your dishwasher is not releasing rinse aid. The rinse aid dispensing cap is located on the inner door panel of your dishwasher. The rinse aid cap could be loose and may just need to be refitted, but could also be warped or damaged from the heat of the water in the dishwasher. Remove the cap from the door and inspect it for signs of melting or warping and replace if need be. If your dishwasher is not dispensing detergent, the spring and hinge pin on the dispenser door could be the problem. The dispenser door is spring loaded, and is held in the closed position by a catch. Check that the spring and pin are not bent or broken and replace if required. If the catch is not releasing the door, then you should inspect the timer, the bi-metal release or the wax motor.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

It protects the handle from scratches, dents, and general wear and tear, which can occur over time. It also contributes to the appearance of the dishwasher by concealing any exposed screws and providing a finished look to the handles. When replacing the end caps, you will need to first remove the door panel. Each end cap is sold individually.",

        "description": "The rinse aid cap (sometimes referred to as the dispenser cap), covers the rinse aid dispenser on the dishwasher door. If your dishwasher will not dispense detergent, or it is leaking detergent, there could be an issue with the rinse aid cap. Check the cap and its gasket for any damage or melting. If the cap has melted or it is not sealing the dispenser properly, the part should be replaced right away. This rinse aid cap comes with the gasket, so you should discard the existing gasket and rinse aid cap at the same time. The repair is relatively straightforward, and requires no tools.",

If you have a multimeter you can measure the resistance of your heating element which should read somewhere between 15 and 30 ohms. A reading above 30 means the element is faulty and will need to be replaced. If the resistance reading is OK then check the wiring and control board for damage. Hope this helps!"

I recently found online a way to re set which is heated dry and normal 2x but i am wondering if there is more wrong that i should worry about. I recently ordered the cap for the dispense to maybe that will help. It seems my dishes are not getting as clean as they should and the soap not all the way breaking down. Do you think ordering the new cap will solve that issue? I have gone without one for month and just started recently having this problem more often.",
                "answer": "Hi Marissa,\nThank you for your question.  The lights will blink on your dishwasher if your dishwasher detects an error.  In this case there is a cleaning error.  If the dishwasher is not cleaning the dishes correctly, you will need to check the chopper assembly, the spinner kit, the spray arm seal, the sump pump check valve, the spray arm seal, the impeller and seal kit, the heating element, the water inlet valve and the circulation pump.  Also, the water may not be hot enough to dissolve the soap.  Before running a cycle, turn the hot water on and let it run for a few minutes and then run a cycle and make sure there is good water pressure.  If the dishes are not getting clean, the dishes may be loaded in a way that prevents all of the dishes from being cleaned.  Try arranging them so that the water can reach all of them.  Try varying the amount of soap used as well to see if that helps.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

What do you think?",

This woudl be an issue with the Wax Motor on the back of the dispenser, PartSelect Number PS11750654 or the control board PartSelect Number PS11748221 not telling the dispenser to open the rinse aid. I suggest starting with the wax motor and test it to see if there is continuity and if so the board might be defective. Hope this helps!"

We cleaned out most of the crud and tried to remove the remaining crud around the flood switch (308), then ran it again this morning. I listened and thought i heard some water running, but when i opened it after the cycle finished, it was still dry, and most or all of the dishwasher liquid residue left from the previous failure to clean was still here. I tried turning the flood switch, and was able to twist is up to about 90 degrees, but it did not come out. Is this likely to be a flood switch problem, and if i need to replace it, how can i get it out? -- thanks, jeff hecht",
                "answer": "Hello Jeff, Thank you for your inquiry. The two parts we would recommend checking to solve this issue are the flood switch and water inlet valve. You can test the parts with a multimeter. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, there are YouTube videos available to assist you. To remove the flood switch, You will have to remove the lower rack, remove the lower wash arm, remove the lower coarse filter, removed fine filter, and you may have to remove the filter adaptor as well. Removed two 1/4\" head screws with nut driver to then remove float switch, unplugged float switch, plugged in new switch, and reverse the process. Hope this helps!"

Prior to this, during heated dry there was bad odor coming from steam escape vent at front of washer.  Heat coil are covered with what i believe is lime.  Would any of this have caused the unit to not draw water?  Also, do i have to remove the unit to work on the flood switch or can it be done in place/",
                "answer": "Hi Paula,\n\nThank you for your question. It sounds like you  may need to take a look at your water inlet valve. That would be my first go to for what would not be bringing water into your appliance. You should be able to test that valve with a multi meter. Yes you would have to remove the unit to get to the valve and check the flood switch as well. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

Next remove the tie holding the harness to the sump and remove the lower rack and lower spray arm. Remove the filter vents by turning counter clockwise to remove. Remove the twist and lock fine filter and the course filter.  Remove the tab lock filter adapter by pulling up on the adapter. Remove any water in the sump area. Remove the two 1/4 in. hex head screws holding the floor plate and flood switch and remove the floor plate and flood sensor. Lift the sensor and floor plate out of sump. Remove the harness to the flood switch assembly. Reverse the steps to install replacement part. Hope this helps!"

                "question": "My dishwasher is only 2 years old but doesn't dry the dishes now, they used to come out scolding hot when it was done. Now they are drenched and sometimes smell from sitting wet too long.  I tested the element and it tested good, but i still went ahead and replaced it to make sure it wasn't the problem. It still doesn't dry the dishes. I was told by a friend that it may be the high limit thermostat. I remember seeing something like that in connection with the element underneath but i can't find the part number anywhere to replace it. Any other ideas on how to get the part number or other ideas of what it could be??\nthank you",

Trying to avoid getting soaked with a repair bill on my GE profile dishwasher, hoping to get a bit of insight or confirmation that the flood switch is the most likely problem.  We've had the dishwasher for about 4 years, did not really do much maintenance at all until recently when the dishes starting coming out wet.  Cleaned out the filter at the bottom of the unit, which was quite loaded up with residue, but would still pass water \"pretty well\".  Neither the type of cycle selected, \"power dry\" setting, nor the temp of the input water (by running sink until hot) has any noticeable effect.Thanks for your help!\n\ntodd",
                "answer": "Hi Todd, thank you for your question. The flood switch can sometimes cause this issue, however most of the time the first part to check is actually the heating element for your appliance. That part tends to be the issue more times than not. You can test that part with a multi meter. The element should be reading between 0 - 50 ohms of resistance to be in working condition. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

When opening the door water came flooding out the front door on both sides, pulled the dishwasher out, checked pipe no blockage, had pipe in sink started rinse cycle, water had no problem going up pipe and into sink.  I thought the problem was solved, bu I started the wash cycle, about 15 - 20 minutes in the cycle, the water once again started coming out but this time it seemed like it was coming out just under and behind the door.

I found that if I run past the rinse cycle to drain it will drain out slowly (gravity?), but the water pressure will not allow it to empty into the disposal. Is this the solenoid or another part that has failed? I see the motor spinning during other parts of the wash cycle, but not during the drain.",

It does sound like you will probably need to replace this part. I would suggest testing the part with a multi-meter first, just to be sure. Good luck with your repair."

Is there something else wrong or that should be checked?",

We have researched the model number you have provided and it could be an issue with the wiring or with the dishwasher timer, which can cause the solenoid to stay powered up for too long and overheat. Check the wires for any visible damage, and check the timer with a multimeter. We hope this helps and if you need help placing an order, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!"

                "answer": "Hi Anell,\nThank you for your question.  When your multi-meter is set the R x 1 setting, place each of the meter's probes on one terminal each. When the probes touch the terminals, the reading should change from a reading of infinity to a reading of approximately 40 ohms. If you receive a reading of infinity, or a reading that is no where near 40 ohms, then you will need to replace the solenoid.  Where the reading is near 40 ohms the drain solenoid and bracket assembly should be fine.  We hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day."

        "description": "This door latch (Dishwasher Door Latch Assembly, Door Latch Assembly, Latch Assembly) is a simple on/off mechanism that prohibits the dishwasher from operating when the door is open. It is located on the door of your dishwasher, and is mounted on the inner door panel. The door latch can break from material fatigue. If the door is often slammed or opened quickly, the latch may break prematurely. If the door won't open or the door switches won't activate, you will need to replace this part. This latch measures 5 1/2 inches wide, 4 1/2 inches high, 2 1/2 inches deep, is constructed out of plastic and comes in black. The kit includes the black handle, latch, and 2 switches.",

                "answer": "Hello Jamie. This is the correct assembly WPW10130695 for your white dishwasher, and it includes everything you need to replace the handle. To begin this repair, unplug your dishwasher or disconnect the power. You will want to remove the screws that are holding the inner door to remove the inner door panel. You will see wires leading to the old latch assembly, remove them and the assembly. Using the same steps but backwards you can connect the new assembly, put it back in place, and reattach the inner door panel. Good luck with this repair!"

                "answer": "Hi David, great question. You are right, the only way to open a jammed door would be to lift the door and with controlled movements to jerk it outwards. Before attempting this, we recommend checking the dishwasher to make sure it is properly mounted so that the jerking movement does not slide it out of place and hurt the dishwasher. Otherwise, by doing this you will not be at risk for breaking anything. Just be careful and give yourself some space. I hope this helps."

Once the screws are removed the panel will come right off and expose the handle screws. Once the screws are exposed you can remove the screws holding the end caps and handle in place and then reverse the steps.\n\nHope this helps!"

                "answer": "Hi Brad, Thank you for the question. The drain hose may not have a loop in it. The fill water may be draining out of the dishwasher by going straight out the drain hose. Be sure that your drain hose is not simply laying straight. It must have a loop in it or be off the ground so the water is not gravity fed out via the drain hose. You can also try to empty the dishwasher, set it to run a wash cycle. Let it fill with water as normal. When the dishwasher begins the cycle, open the door and see if the water level is just under the heating elements.If there is not enough water there may be a clog in your water fill line. Remove the fill hose where it attaches to the fill valve. Check to be sure there is nothing clogging the screen on the inlet fill valve. Also check the water fill line for blockage. You can also check the Overfill Control Switch if it is not filling with water at the correct level. If it is defective it can shut the water flow off too soon. Hope this helps!"

You can try running the hot water in the adjoining sink to get the hot water up to max temperature before starting the dishwasher. If this does not help try opening the door a bit during the wash cycle to see if there is steam indicating the water is hot.

The electronic control board is PS8260225 - this is rarely the issue, but it could be worth cutting off power to the dishwasher for one minute and then restarting it to see if that fixes the issue before replacing the board.

Without the rinse aid, the dishes will not shed water easily and they will not dry properly.  Your rinse aid dispenser will be found on the inside of the door, open the rinse aide door on the dispenser.   After verifying that there is rinse aid in the chamber, inspect the door and chamber for any signs of discoloration, warping, or any other damage.  If you find any issues with your rinse aid dispenser door while performing this inspection, you will need to replace the detergent dispenser.  The part number listed under your model number for the detergent dispenser is PS11731570.  If you need to place an order for it, customer service is open 7 days a week and anyone will be happy to assist you.  Please feel free to give us a call.  We look forward to hearing from you!"

                "question": "My dishwasher occasionally keeps washing dishes and never stops until we open the door and manually set it to drain.  We think it might only do this when we use the normal wash cycle, bunt we haven’t experienced it on express wash.  We think it is just an ever ending wash cycle,and never drains.  Water gets hot, everything else seems to work.  Thanks for any advice.",
                "answer": "Hello Jeremy, thank you for your question. We would recommend testing/replacing the thermostat and the turbidity sensor. If the sensor is bad, it will continue to detect dirty water and keep washing. I hope this helps."

                "question": "Our dishwasher won't complete it's cycles.  If i just start it, it will fill with water then just blink the front light - not run.  If i run the water at the faucet until it is really hot, it will complete the first cycle, but, then it may not run the rinse cycle.  If it completes that, it begins blinking during the dry cycle.I assume the problem is with the heater or the thermostat.  is there a way to determine which without removing the parts and testing? are there any other parts that could be at fault?",
                "answer": "Hello Jim, Thank you for the question. Unfortunately the only way to know for sure if they are defective is to remove and test them. If the element and thermostat is good, you may need to replace the main control board. Hope this helps, good luck with this repair!"
            },
            {
                "question": "Following up on my prior question - i measured the resistance of the heating element - it was 12 ohms which seems to be an acceptable range from the other messages.  I then measured the resistance of the thermostat (assuming it is the part on the spring bracket near the front of the dishwasher near the water inlet) and it was zero at room temperature.  You'd commented previously that this connection was normally open at room temperature, so, is it good or bad?  If bad - can you tell me how to remove it?If good do you have other suggestions of what i can check to find out what is wrong with our dishwasher?",
                "answer": "Hello Jim, Thank you for the question. If there is no reading at all then it sounds like it can be defective. The thermostat just plugs into place.  Hope this helps, good luck with this repair!"

Let it stand overnight and run an empty cycle the following morning.   When the cycle is complete, scrub away any remaining dirt from the bottom of the dishwasher.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

                "answer": "Hi Dan,\nThank you for your question.  To test the motor with a multimeter, disconnect the motor's two wire leads from the wiring harness. Set your multimeter to the R x 1 setting. Touch each of the meter's probes to one terminal each. Your motor should show little resistance (a reading of zero, or close to zero).  Now check the ground connection. Place one probe on the bare metal housing of the motor. Place the other probe on each terminal, one at a time. You should not receive any reading on your meter from this test. If your dishwasher's motor fails either of these tests, you will have to replace it.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

                "answer": "Hello Agotino, thank you for reaching out. The bE error code is triggered by improper detergent use or a dishwasher that is not level. Using the wrong detergent leads to excess sudsing, causing parts like the vent to become filled with soap foam. A dishwasher that is not level will do the same, causing water to flow to parts where it does not belong, potentially damaging components. To fix the issue adjust leveling feet as necessary. To remove detergent residue in the tub pour approximately three to seven ounces of milk into a shallow bowl and place it in the upper rack and run the dishwasher on the Auto cycle. We hope this solves your problem!"

I've replaced the water control valve and circulation pump. It drains fine. To test water level i added a couple quarts of additional water after the filling process. I hear a series of clicks from the control panel. It appears to run through the cycles but never spray the water. Help please.",
                "answer": "Hello Dan, Thank you for your inquiry. I would check both of your spray arms to make sure they are not clogged. We would also check your impeller motor and pump assembly to make sure it is working properly to force the water up through the wash arms. You can also test the Turbidity Sensor with a multimeter to make sure it is functioning as well. Hope this helps!"

There are some parts that you may need to check as well to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the drain hose, the filter, the turbidity sensor and the heating element.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

It waits the appropriate time and then drains and continues.  What it doesn't do is spray water through the arms or dispense the detergent.   I checked that the arms aren't clogged, checked that the float moves freely, checked whether the inlet valve was clogged, ran a quart of vinegar through it which visibly cleaned some fat out of the drain hose, and checked the door switch with a multimeter and it is fine.  This looks like an easy job and i can actually reach it from the front of the machine, but should i be looking at anything else first? Thanks!",

After doing the checks with the spray arms and door switch, yes we would also suggest replacing the turbidity sensor under part PS11757214 for your model to fix the issues, as there aren't any other parts other then the control board as a last case scenario that would fix the issues.

Drain pump and control board were previously replaced under warranty. This problem has occurred intermittently over the years but now occurs every time. If i run the machine four times it will finally finish the cycle. I don't want to just throw parts at it, Bosch will not sell me a service manual so i can test it. I would appreciate advice.",

Since the issue is persistent, we would recommend testing/replacing the sensors, PartSelect Number PS8727345 and PartSelect Number PS8727445. If those are tested/replaced and are not the issue, the drain pump or board may have failed again. I hope this helps."

According to Bosch codes that means water flow sensor fault overfilling problem. In my sump next to the filter are 2 sensors, one above the other. One i think is to determine the soil level on the auto cycle. Is the other one the water level sensor?",
                "answer": "Hello Jim, thank you for your question. The turbidity sensor measures the soil level in the water that is going through the pump and sump. As the soil level increases, the amount of transmitted light decreases. The turbidity sensor measures the amount of transmitted light to determine the turbidity of the wash water. These turbidity measurements are supplied to the dishwasher controller, which makes decisions on how long to wash in all the cycles.The E17 code is indicating the unit is getting too much water into the tub. We would recommend testing or replacing the float switch and water valve first. I hope this helps!"

The dishwasher displays water tap while running, followed by water leaking to the float and an E15 error.\n\nI checked everything and the drain line is completely clear, and it drains fine when you reset it. I bought new tub seal and door seals from you and installed them. For some reason the tub is still overfilling and then overflowing while running.\n\nIs this a fill level sensor or some other way to control the fill?",
                "answer": "Hello Harry, thank you for your inquiry. An E15 error code indicates that the safety switch has detected water in the base of the dishwasher. Your leakage protection system has activated. Check to make sure the water inlet hose and sump seal are not damaged or worn-out and are leading to water leakage. If this does not solve the issue, we would recommend checking the float switch assembly, part number PS8737139. Float switch assembly shuts the water fill valve off if the water level gets too high before the timed fill cycle ends. Good luck with the repair!"

They do press in rather hard though, so you have to use a bit of force to get them to snap in place. Follow these steps for step-by-step instructions:\n1: To replace the control cover on your dishwasher, you will need to pull the appliance a few inches away from the cabinet in order to fully remove the door.\n2: Use a quarter-inch socket or nut driver to remove the screws securing the lower access panel.\n3: Remove the panel along with any insulation and determine if the power line and water supply line have enough slack to move the dishwasher.\n4: Remove the panel along with any insulation and determine if the power line and water supply line have enough slack to move the dishwasher.\n5: If not, you will need to shut off the water supply valve then use channel–lock pliers to help unthread the water supply line fitting from the inlet valve to be prepared for some water to spill.\n5: Next, use a 5/16th inch socket or nut driver to unthread the screw, securing the junction box cover. Then pull the cover off.\n6: Unthread the strain relief nut and detach the strain relief from the junction box.\n7: Next, disconnect the drain hose from the sink or garbage disposer and feed it through the cabinet.\n8: Open the dishwasher door and remove the mounting bracket screws.\n9: Unhook both door cables from the hinges.\n10: Disconnect the door wire connecter and detach the wires from the retainer.\n11: Now open the door and lift up to remove it from the hinge supports.\n12: Use the quarter-inch socket or nut driver to unthread the two lower screws securing the hinges.\n13: Slide the hinges out.\n14: Now remove the upper screws securing the inner door panel to the outer panel.\n15: Slide the inner panel up to detach it. If still intact, lift the old control cover up and push forward to remove.\n16: Install the new control cover by aligning the cover tabs with the slots in the inner panel, then snap the cover into place.\n17: With the control cover installed, realign the tabs on the inner panel with the slots on the outer panel and slide the inner panel down.\n18: Replace the screws to secure the two panels.\n19: Reposition both door hinges on the support rails and replaces the screws to secure.\n20: Reinstall the door by aligning the hinge pins in the hinge supports.\n21: Close the door, then reconnect the door wire connecter and secure the wires in the retainer.\n22: Hook both door cables onto the hinges. Connect the wires using the wire nuts.\n23: Align the cover and replace the screw to secure. Reconnect the water supply line to the inlet valve.\n24: Replace any insulation then reposition the lower access panel. Secure it with the screws.\n25: With the repair completed, turn the water supply back on as well as the power and your dishwasher should be ready for use.\nWe hope that helps!"

        "description": "This part replaces your appliances latch (Door Latch Kit, Door Catch, Dryer Door Latch Kit). On your appliance you will find both a strike and a catch. The strike is mounted on the body of the dryer, while the catch is mounted on the dryer door. These two parts work together to keep your dryer door closed. The catch holds the door strike to keep the door closed during the drying cycle. If the door does not latch closed, you won’t be able to start a drying cycle. If this part is malfunctioning, you may not be able to open or close your door. In some instances, it may seem like your door is closing, but if it is not latching properly you won’t be able to start your drying cycle. You should replace this part as soon as it’s malfunctioning. Your dryer may run even though the latch is malfunctioning, but it is unsafe if the dryer continues to run while the door is open. This replacement part features 1 door latch kit which includes 2 strikes, 3 catches, and a set of instructions. This model is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in white/silver.",

                "answer": "Hi Joanne, it sounds like you need to replace the door switch, it is part number WP3406105. Best of luck with this repair!"

                "answer": "Hello Eric,\n\nThanks for your question. Number 020 is the yellow catch. Number 022 is the blue catch. Number 025 is the green catch. If the catch you are replacing has an 18 on it or if it is silver, use the 020 yellow catch. If nothing matches check if your dryer has one catch, and make sure it is not a 27\" Wide Laundry Center or a Commercial Stacked Pair and if that is true, use the 020 yellow catch. If it is either of those types of machines, use the 025 green catch. If your dryer has two catches, use the 022 blue catch on the top and the 020 yellow catch on the bottom.\n\nI hope this helps."

                "question": "My dryer will not start when i push the start button.  I have already replaced the door switch, but that did not fix the problem.  Here is what's happening;  when i have the dryer set to start and close the door, the dryer makes a soft whirring/clicking sound.  When i push the start button, there is a loud click, the whirring stops, but the dryer does not start.  Do these symptoms give any indication of which part might be faulty?",
                "answer": "Hi Erin,\n\nThank you for your question. There are a couple of other parts that you would check to see if they are working correctly. The first part I would actually suggest testing is your start switch. You may also want to test your thermal fuse as well. You can test both parts with a multi meter to see what the continuity is on them. If both of those parts are fine you might go on to test your thermostats and your element as well. If those parts are fine then it may be your timer that is the issue. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

Do you have any idea where that may have come from? I think someone may have put too much weight on the door and forced it past the normal stop position. I will order the latch anyway but I am wondering if anything else could be wrong? In addition, the light burned out. Does it require the exact replacement bulb?",
                "answer": "Hello Gerald,\n\nThanks for your question. The door catch kit would be the most likely solution for your problem based on your description. As for the bulb, we are only showing one bulb that is compatible with your machine based on the manufacturer's part list.\n\nI hope this helps."

                "answer": "Hi Laura, Thank you for the question. The catch can be swapped to the other side yes but it sounds like there could be an issue with the door switch,PartSelect Number PS3653055. If the switching the catch did not fix the issue I recommend replacing the switch. Hope this helps!"

                "answer": "Hi Morgan, thank you for your question. These would be the instructions from the manufacturer: This kit contains (2) door strikes and various door catches. Some dryers may use more than (1) catch. Note numbers stamped on the catches and/or color of the spring steel, 20 (yellow), 22 (blue) or 25 (green). Match the number and/or color, of the catch being replaced with the catch supplied in the kit. If the catch you’re replacing has an 18 stamped on it or is silver in color, use the catch stamped with 20 (yellow) for replacement. The (2) door strikes contained in the kit are the same. Please replace the door strike(s) with the appropriate number of door catches being used for this repair. If you cannot match the number on the catches, match the catch(es) by the following: 1. If your dryer has one catch and is not a 27” Wide Laundry Center or Commercial Stacked Pair, use the catch stamped with 20 (yellow) for replacement. If it is a 27” Laundry Center or Commercial Stacked Pair, use the catch stamped with 25 (green) for replacement. 2. If your dryer has 2 catches, use the catch stamped with 22 (blue) on the top and the catch stamped 20 (yellow) on the bottom.  I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."

You will need to check the thermal fuse, the door catch and strike, the internal bias thermostat, the drive belt,  the idler pulley and the drive motor.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

                "answer": "Hello Pius, if you are experiencing problems with your buzzer shutting off, that would be a motor switch issue. It sounds like the motor switch is sticking/stuck and the only way to correct that would be to replace the motor. You can find the motor for your model here 279827. I hope this helps!"

Replacing the seal may help with the issue of the spray arm not cleaning the top rack properly. However, if this does not solve the problem, you can visit our repair help section to determine what other parts could cause this symptom. I hope this helps you, and good luck with the repair."

                "answer": "Hi Cherri,\nThank you for your question.  If the dishes on the upper rack are not getting clean, there are some parts that you will need to check to see which one is causing the issue.  You will need to check the chopper assembly, the spinner kit, the spray arm seal, sump pump check valve, the spray arm seal, the impellar and seal kit, the heating element, the circulation pump and motor, the lower spray arm support/hub, the water supply manifold probe and the feed tube assembly with spinner.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"

If the puck motor is defective, it can cause a lot of noise and not pump the water to the spray arms allowing it to reach the soap dispenser to use the soap. Hope this helps, good luck with this repair!"

                "answer": "Hi Louis,\nThank you for your question.  If the timer is stopping mid-cycle, there may be an issue with the heating element.  If the heating element malfunctions, this will sometimes cause the dishwasher to stop mid-cycle.  To test the element, set your multi-meter to Rx1 and touch each probe to a terminal. Your reading should be somewhere between zero and infinity, refer to your owner’s manual to determine what reading you should receive for your model. If it is exactly zero or infinity it is defective. If your test produces a reading different from the manufacturer’s recommendation, you will need a replacement heating element. If the element is fine then check the timer.  Set your multi-meter to Rx1000 and touch the contacts with the probes. Most functioning timers will fall in the range of 2000-3500 ohms of resistance, but this varies between models. Refer to your owner's manual to determine what reading your test should produce. If your test results differ from the manufacturer's recommendations, you will need a replacement timer. We hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day."

All cycles will work if I move the selector but again it doesn't move without me turning the dial. I suspect it's the timer but don't want to purchase it unless that is the part I need. Can you tell me if my thought is correct or not and if I'm wrong what you think the issue is and what part I need to order?",
                "answer": "Hello Kevin, thank you for contacting us. It seems like there is a problem with your dishwasher timer, part number PS4704218. The timer manages the various dishwasher functions such as filling, washing, draining and drying and it is responsible for cycle selection. We hope that helps!"

                "answer": "Hi Mark,\nThank you for your question.  There is a delayed hour button on your dishwasher where you can delay a cycle for 2, 4, or 8 hours.  If this button was pressed a couple of times, this may be the reason the dishwasher washer was still running.  If this was not the issue, you can try installing it to the hot water to see if this helps, if not you may need to replace the timer.  If you have any questions, please let us know.  We are open 7 days a week.  We look forward to hearing from you!"

According to our research, you need to do the following things to fix your issue: check for blockages, load the dishwasher correctly, clean or change the filter, part number PS3511267, inspect the drain hose, part number PS260686, double-check the drain valve, and try vinegar and baking soda. If these cannot fix your issue then you will need to check the following parts: drain solenoid kit, part number PS1481923, and the pump and motor assembly, part number PS3486941. Please reach out to customer service if you need help placing an order. Glad to be of help!"

You will need to check the door latch and switches, the electronic control board, the control panel, the heating element and the vent assembly.  We have included a link that you may reference on how to check these parts.  Once you have determined the part you need, please feel free to call customer service.  We are open 7 days a week and anyone will be happy to assist you.  We look forward to hearing from you!"

                "answer": "Hello Parker, Thank you for your inquiry. It could be either an issue with the console or the control board. You can actually test this by disconnecting the power to the dishwasher, then unplugging the console from the control board, then putting the door back together. Leaving the door open, turn the power on to the dishwasher. Wait 10 minutes and then shut the door. If there is an issue with the console, the control board will detect it has been disconnected and turn the drain pump on. If the drain pump does not come on, then it's an issue with the control board. We hope this helps and if you need help placing an order for a part, customer service is open 7 days a week. Please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!"

I have put it back together, turned the breaker back on. I got all panel lights on, then just the cycle lights and I was able to start. This has never happened before. Do you think I could have reset it?",

I put it through a water test got through the end of the water test had a clear s code but  the drain pump was still running. it will not cut off unless I open the door, I'm leaning towards a bad circuit board what do you think?",
                "answer": "Hi Rick,\nThank you for your question.  If you have checked the float, the drain hose and the sump and the pump is still running, there may be some standing water on the bottom under the cavity.

After a storm, the display on the front of the dishwasher only displays code A. I Flipped the breaker and left the power off for at least 15 minutes. When I powered it back on, it had a PF (to indicate power failure)  code but as soon as I opened it, it went back to the code A. None of the buttons on the control panel do anything. It Continues to have the A error. Does this sound like a control panel issue?",
                "answer": "Hi Tammy, thanks for the great question. Yes, this could be that your control board has burned out. We also recommend inspecting both your drain pump and circulation pump to make sure they are functioning properly. If one of them are drawing too much power from the board, it will need to be replaced before it does damage to the board. If you would like assistance placing an order, please contact Customer Service. Good luck with your repair!"

The new drain pump works great and is very quiet but all of a sudden I lost all power and control of the dishwasher unit. No lights on the control display or anything. I flipped the breaker and confirmed I have 120VAC to the unit but still is completely dead.\n\nI’m worried I might have shorted something in the pump repair? But not even sure how that could have happened.",
                "answer": "Hello Jake, thank you for your question. We have researched your model and found that the issue is probably with the control board, part number PS12365809. If you require assistance to place an order, please contact customer service. We hope that helps!"

If one of the leveling screws is stripped, damaged, or missing, you may not be able to create a level base for your dryer. The leveling screw has a hexagon-shaped gray plastic foot, with a screw that is approximately 1 inch in length. To replace a damaged screw, simply turn the old screw to the left, until it can be removed. Then, simply screw the new leveling screw into place on the bottom of the dryer, making sure it is the same height as the other 3 leveling screws.",

                "answer": "Hi Joseph,\nThank you for your question.  We do not have a video for this part, but here is some information that a customer posted that may help you with your repair, \"Turn off the power to the unit at your breaker panel.  The air inlet strip is fastened to the backside of the inner stainless steel door panel.  To access the screws, the outer door panel must be removed.  Open the door and remove the six torx head screws that fasten the outer door panel to the stainless steel inner door.  Do not remove the two top center torx screws as they hold the door latch in place.   After removing the screws, raise the door up to the nearly closed position.  Lift up the outer door panel handle and door bottom to disengage the outer panel from the inner stainless door.  The next part is a little tricky since the vent strip hex head screws are at he bottom of the stainless door panel, facing out with the door closed.  The lip of the bottom stainless pan is high enough to make it a tight fit to access the screws.  There is also a steel bracket that is a door stiffener and it holds the electrical wiring.  I found removing the bracket held by a 1/4 inch hex head screw on each side made access to the vent strip screws easier.  Lay it flat on the floor.  With a 3/16 inch nut driver or socket wrench remove each of the five vent strip screws.  It is a tight fit between the bottom lip and door bottom, but it can be done.  Remove the old vent strip and attach the new one.  Make sure it fits snugly into the slot. Best to have an extra pair of hands at this point to hold the strip securely in place while the screws are reinserted from the opposite side.  Reassemble everything in reverse order.\"   We hope this helps!  If you have any questions, please let us know."

                "answer": "Hi Stephen, thank you for reaching out. Based on our research, it is a common issue that occurs because of high resistance at the terminal. Corrosion, or a loose connection, can cause the high resistance. The high resistance causes heating, which leads to more heating, and eventually the insulation on the wire starts to melt. We would suggest checking the connections first. If these are fine, the issue could be with the terminal block, part number PS8729475. You may need to replace it to fix the issue. If you install it correctly, hopefully, it will not happen again. We hope this information helps!!"

You can test them with a multi meter and they should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. If that part is fine you should go on to check these parts: your turbidity sensor, overflow control switch, and thermostat. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."
